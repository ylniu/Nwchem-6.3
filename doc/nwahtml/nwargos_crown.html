<p>
This example goes through the complete sequence of steps to perform a
free energy difference simulation in which Na+ is mutated into K+,
complexed to the crown ether 18C6, in aqueous solution.
<p>
<ol>
<li>
The crown ether wil be built from CH2-O-CH2 fragments. This fragment
is not part of the standard segment database. Also a corresponding fragment 
is not part of the fragment library. The fragment is created using an
editor, and should be named 
<a href="nwargos_crown_frg.html">coc_______.frg</a>.
<p>
<li>
The fragment just created is force field independent. To create the
force field <b>amber</b> dependent segment file, give the command
<p>
<tt>nwsgm coc_______ amber</tt>
<p>
This command searches the fragment libraries and the local file
<b>coc_______.frg</b> for a fragment entry <tt>$coc</tt>.
The generic atom types defined in the fragment are substituted for
the <b>amber</b> atom types. The translation tables are found in
the atom type translation library files or the local file
<b>coc_______.att</b>, if present. 
A segment file <a href="nwargos_crown_sgm.html">coc_______.sgm</a>
is created that should be renamed to <b>crown.sgm</b>.
Alternatively, this file may be appended to
<b>amber_u.sgm</b> or <b>amber_r.sgm</b>, provided that these library
files are defined in the file <b>$HOME/.nwargos</b>.
<p>
<li>
A sequence file needs to be created, defining the molecular system
in terms of segments. Using an editor create the file
<a href="nwargos_crown_seq.html">crown.seq</a>. This file defines
the 18C6 crown ether in terms of six cyclicly arranged <tt>coc</tt>
fragments. It also specifies the solvent as the SPC/E water model.
<p>
<li>
The topology file <a href="nwargos_crown_top.html">crown.top</a> is
created, giving the command
<p>
<tt>nwtop crown amber</tt>
<p>
This command searches the <b>amber</b> sequence database files, and
the local sequence file <b>crown.seq</b> for a sequence <tt>crown</tt>.
The force field needs to be given in order to search the correct
database files. If the sequence is found, it searches the <b>amber</b>
segment databases and the local segment file <b>crown.sgm</b> for all
segments specified in the sequence. When all segments have been found,
the topology is generated using the rules appropriate for the force
field. All parameters not explicitly given in the segment are added
from the <b>amber</b> parameter library files, and the local file
<b>crown.par</b> if present. Any segments or parameters not found
can be supplied in the local files.
