<b><em>File names</em></b>
<p>
File names used by <em>nwARGOS</em> need to have the form
<b>project_id.ext</b>, with exception of the <a href="nwargos_topology.html">
topology</a> file, which should be named <b>project.top</b>, and the input
file for <em>NWChem</em>, which should simply be <b>project</b>.
Anything that refers to the definition of the chemical system can be used
for <b>project</b>, as long as no periods or underlines are used. <br>
The identifier <b>id</b> can be anything that refers to the type of calculation 
to be performed for the system.<br> 
The <a href="nwargos_extensions.html">extensions</a> <b>ext</b> 
identify the kind of information on the file, and are determined by the 
programs. Examples of extensions are <b>top</b> for the topology file, 
<b>rst</b> for the restart file and <b>inp</b> for the input file.
<p>
This file naming convention allows for the creation of a single topology file
<b>project.top</b> for a chemical system with which a number of different 
calculations, identified with different <b>id</b>.

<b><em>Database names</em></b>
<p>
A similar convention is used to identify databases used by the setup programs
<a href="nwargos_nwTOP.html"><em>nwTOP</em></a>, 
<a href="nwargos_nwRST.html"><em>nwRST</em></a> and
<a href="nwargos_nwSGM.html"><em>nwSGM</em></a>. 
Force field database names have the form
<b>forcefield_level.ext</b>, where <b>forcefield</b> stands for any of the
<a href="nwargos_forcefields.html">supported force fields</a>. The source
of the data is identified by <b>level</b>, and can be 
<p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>level</th><th>Description</th><th>Availability</th>

<tr>
<td><b>s</b></td><td>original published data</td><td>public</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>x</b></td><td>additional published data</td><td>public</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>u</b></td><td>user preferred data</td><td>private</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>r</b></td><td>user defined run specific data</td><td>private</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Only the level <b>s</b> and <b>x</b> databases are publicly available. The user is
responsible for the private level <b>u</b> and <b>r</b> databases.
<p>
Other database files include the force field independent fragment libraries and
the solvation restart files.
