<h2>SPC/E water</h2>
Input files for molecular dynamics simulations of pure water are available for five different
system sizes. These systems were chosen to contain 1, 8, 27, 64 and 125 identical boxes of
216 SPC/E water molecules. Since the velocities are also identical in each box, the results
of a molecular dynamics simulation should be identical for each of these systems. This not
only provides a means of checking proper execution of the code, but also allows for
timings as a function of system size.

<h2>Myoglobin</h2>
<p>
As an example of a solvated protein, input files for myoglobin in aqueous solution are 
available. This system has been used previously in the literature to benchmark parallel
molecular dynamics codes.

<h2>Speedup curves</h2>
<p>
For selected benchmarks speedup curves are compared as obtained for the 
<a href="nwargos_bmrks_water_ksr.html">KSR-2</a> and the 
<a href="nwargos_bmrks_water_sp2.html">IBM SP-2</a>.
