<h1>Topology generator <em>nwTOP</em></h1>
<hr>
<p>
The <a href="nwargos_topology.html">topology</a> describes all static information
that describes a molecular system. This includes the connectivity, such
as bond-stretching, angle-bending and torsional interactions, as well as
non-bonded interactions, such as van der Waals and Coulombic interactions.
<p>
The <a href="nwargos_topology.html">topology</a> of a molecular system is 
generated by the topology generator <em>nwTOP</em>. The molecular system
is described in terms of segments taken out of a database of predefined
segments. Segments that are not available in one of the database files
can be generated bye a utility program 
<a href="nwargos_nwSGM.html">nwSGM</a>.
<p>
The command line to run <em>nwTOP</em> is
<p>
<tt>nwtop project forcefield</tt>
<p>
where <b>project</b> is the name of a sequence on one of the
sequence databases or a local file <b>project.seq</b>, and
<b>forcefield</b> is the name of one of the 
<a href="nwargos_forcefields.html">available force fields</a>.
Force field parameters are taken from the parameter databases,
or from a local file <b>project.par</b> is present. The 
<a href="nwargos_parameters.html"> format of the parameter
file</a> is identical to the <em>ARGOS</em> parameter file
format.
The resulting topology file is <b>project.top</b>
<p>
The input for <em>nwTOP</em> is taken from a sequence database, or
given in a formatted sequence file <b>project.seq</b>. A sequence
file may be appended to a sequence database. The 
<a href="nwargos_sequence.html">format of a sequence
file</a> is slightly different from the <em>ARGOS</em> sequence file
format.
