\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Spacial decomposition}
The molecular dynamics module of \nwchem\ uses a distribution of data
based on a spacial decomposition of the molecular system, offering
an efficient parallel implementation in terms of both memory 
requirements and communication costs, especially for simulations of 
large molecular systems.

Inter-processor communication using the global array tools and the
design of a data structure allowing distribution based on spacial
decomposition are the key elements in taking advantage of
the distribution of memory requirements and computational work with
minimal communication.

In the spacial decomposition approach, the physical simulation
volume is divided into rectangular cells, each of which is
assigned to a processor. Depending on the conditions of the 
calculation and the number of available processors, each processor 
contains one or more of these spacially grouped cells.
The most important aspects of this decomposition are the dependence 
of the cell sizes and communication cost on the number of processors 
and the shape of the cells, the frequent reassignment of atoms to 
cells leading to a fluctuating number of atoms per cell, and the 
locality of communication which is the main reason for the efficiency 
of this approach for very large molecular systems.

To improve efficiency, molecular systems are broken up into separately
treated solvent and solute parts. Solvent molecules are assigned to
the domains according to their center of geometry and are always owned
by a one node. This avoids solvent--solvent bonded interactions
crossing node boundaries.  Solute molecules are broken up into
segments, with each segment assigned to a processor based on its
center of geometry.  This limits the number of solute bonded
interactions that cross node boundaries.  The processor to which a
particular cell is assigned is responsible for the calculation of all
interactions between atoms within that cell.  For the calculation of
forces and energies in which atoms in cells assigned to different
processors are involved, data are exchanged between processors. The
number of neighboring cells is determined by the size and shape of the
cells and the range of interaction. The data exchange that takes place
every simulation time step represents the main communication
requirements.  Consequently, one of the main efforts is to design
algorithms and data structures to minimize the cost of this
communication. However, for very large molecular systems, memory
requirements also need to be taken into account.

To compromise between these requirements exchange of data is performed
in successive point to point communications rather than using the
shift algorithm which reduces the number of communication calls
for the same amount of communicated data.

For inhomogeneous systems, the computational load of evaluating 
atomic interactions will generally differ between cell pairs. 
This will lead to load imbalance between processors.
Two algorithms have been implemented that allow for dynamically 
balancing the workload of each processor.
One method is the dynamic resizing of cells such that cells gradually
become smaller on the busiest node, thereby reducing the computational
load of that node. Disadvantages of this method are that the 
efficiency depends on the solute distribution in the simulation volume
and the redistribution of work depends on the number of nodes which
could lead to results that depend on the number of nodes used.
The second method is based on the dynamic redistribution of intra-node
cell-cell interactions. This method represents a more coarse load
balancing scheme, but does not have the disadvantages of the cell
resizing algorithm. For most molecular systems the cell pair
redistribution is the more efficient and preferred  method.

The description of a molecular system consists of static and dynamic
information. The static information does not change during a
simulation and includes items such as connectivity, excluded and third
neighbor lists, equilibrium values and force constants for all
bonded and non-bonded interactions. The static information is called
the topology of the molecular system, and is kept on a separate
topology file. The dynamic information includes coordinates and
velocities for all atoms in the molecular system, and is kept in a
so-called restart file.

\subsection{Topology}
\label{sec:nwatopology}
The static information about a molecular system that is needed for
a molecular simulation is provided to the simulation module in a
topology file. 
Items in this file include, among many other things, 
a list of atoms, their non-bonded parameters for van der Waals and
electrostatic interactions, and the complete connectivity in terms
of bonds, angles and dihedrals.

In molecular systems, a distinction is made between 
{\it solvent} and {\it solute}, which are treated separately.
A solvent molecule is defined only once in the topology file,
even though many solvent molecules usually are included in the
actual molecular system. In the current implementation only one 
solvent can be defined. Everything that is not solvent in the 
molecular system is solute. Each solute atom in the system must 
be explicitly defined in the topology. 

Molecules are defined in terms of one or more {\it segment}s. 
Typically, repetitive parts of a molecule are each defined as a single
segment, such as the amino acid residues in a protein. 
Segments  can be quite complicated to define and are, therefore, 
collected in a set of database files. 
The definition of a molecular system in terms of segments is a
{\it sequence}.

Topology files are created using the \prepare\ module.

\subsection{Files}
\label{sec:nwafilenames}

File names used have the form \verb+$system$_$calc$.$ext$+, with
exception of the topology file (Section \ref{sec:nwatopology}), which is named 
\verb+$system$.top+.
Anything that refers to the definition of the chemical system can be used
for \verb+$system$+, as long as no periods or underlines are used.
The identifier \verb+$calc$+ can be anything that refers to the type of 
calculation to be performed for the system with the topology defined.
This file naming convention allows for the creation of a single
topology file \verb+$system$.top+ that can be used for a number of 
different calculations, each identified with a different \verb+$calc$+.
For example, if {\tt crown.top} is the name of the topology file for
a crown ether, {\tt crown\_em}, {\tt crown\_md}, {\tt crown\_ti} could
be used with appropriate extensions for the filenames for energy
minimization, molecular dynamics simulation and multi-configuration
thermodynamic integration, respectively. All of these calculations
would use the same topology file {\tt crown.top}.

\label{sec:nwaextensions}

The extensions \verb+<ext>+ identify the kind of information on a file,
and are pre-determined.

\subsection{Databases}
Database file supplied with NWChem and used by the \prepare\ module are found in 
directories with name \verb+$ffield$_$level$+, \\
where \verb+$ffield$+ is any of the
supported force fields (Section \ref{sec:nwaforcefields}). 
The source of the data is identified by \verb+$level$+, and can be 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline
level   & Description                \\
{\bf s} & original published data    \\
{\bf x} & additional published data  \\
{\bf q} & contributed data           \\
{\bf u} & user preferred data        \\
{\bf t} & user defined temporary data\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The user is can replace these directories or add additional database files
by specifying them in the $.nwchemrc$ file. or in the \verb+prepare+ input file. 

The extension \verb+1-9+ defines the priority of database file.
 
\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
{\bf frg} & fragments\\
{\bf par} & parameters\\
{\bf seq} & sequences\\
{\bf sgm} & segments\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{List of database file extensions.}
\end{table}


The paths of the different database directories should be defined in a file 
{\tt .nwchemrc} in a user's home directory, and provides the user the
option to select which database files are scanned.

\subsection{Force fields}
\label{sec:nwaforcefields}
Force fields recognized are
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\hline
Keyword       & Force field   & Status \\
{\tt amber}   & AMBER99       & AMBER95,GLYCAM also available\\

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}  
The units for lengths, angles, and energies are correspondingly
nanometers, radians, and kJ/mol.

\section{Format of fragment files}
Fragment files contain the basic information needed to specify all
interactions that need to be considered in a molecular simulation.
The format of the fragment files is described in Table \ref{tbl:nwmdfrg}.
Normally these files are created by the \prepare\ module. Manual
editing is needed when, for example, the \prepare\ module could not
complete atom typing, or when modified charges are required.

\section{Creating segment files}
\label{sec:nwanwsgm}
The \prepare\ module is used to generate segment files 
from corresponding fragment files. A segment file contains all
information for the calculation of bonded and non-bonded interactions
for a given chemical system using a specific force field.

Which atoms form a fragment is specified in the coordinate file,
currently only in PDB format.
the restriction is that bonded interactions may only involve atoms on at
most two segments does no longer exist as of \nwchem\ release 3.2.1. 
The segment entries define three sets of parameters
for each interaction. 

Free energy perturbations can be performed using set 1 for the 
generation of the ensemble while using sets 2 and/or 3
as perturbations. Free energy multiconfiguration thermodynamic
integration and multistep thermodynamic perturbation calculations are
performed by gradually changing the interactions in the system from
parameter set 2 to parameter set 3. These modifications can be 
edited into the segment files manually, or introduced directly into
the topology file using the \verb+modify+ commands in the input for
the \prepare\ module.

The format of a segment is
described in Tables \ref{tbl:nwmdseg1}--\ref{tbl:nwmdseg6}.

\section{Creating sequence files}
A sequence file describes a molecular system in terms of segments. This
file is generated by the \prepare\ module for the molecular system
provided on a PDB-formatted coordinate file.
The file format is given in Table \ref{tbl:nwmdseq}

\section{Creating topology files}
\label{sec:nwanwtop}

The topology (Section \ref{sec:nwatopology}) describes all static information
that describes a molecular system. This includes the connectivity in
terms of bond-stretching, angle-bending and torsional interactions, as well as
the non-bonded van der Waals and Coulombic interactions.

The topology of a molecular system is generated by the \prepare\ module
from the sequence in terms of segments as specified on the PDB file.
For each unique segment specified in this file the 
segment database directories are searched for the segment definition. 
For segments not found in one of the database directories a segment definition
is generated in the temporary directory if a fragment file was found.
If a fragment file could not be found, it is generated by the \prepare\ module
base on what is found on the PDB file.

When all segments are found or created, the parameter substitutions are 
performed, using force field parameters taken from the parameter 
databases. After all lists have been generated the
topology is written to a local topology file \verb+$system$.top+.

\section{Creating restart files}
\label{sec:nwanwrst}

Restart files contain all dynamical information about a molecular
system and are created by the \prepare\ module if a topology file
is available. The \prepare\ module will automatically generate
coordinates for hydrogen atoms and monatomic counter ions
not found on the PDB formatted coordinate file, if no fragment or
segment files were generated using that PDB file.

The \prepare\ module has a number of other optional input command,
including solvation.

\section{Molecular simulations}
The type of molecular dynamics simulation is specified by the
\nwchem\ task directive.
\begin{verbatim}
task md [ energy | optimize | dynamics | thermodynamics ]
\end{verbatim}
where the theory keyword {\tt md} specifies use of the molecular
dynamics module, and the operation keyword is one of
\begin{description}
\item
{\tt energy} for single configuration energy evaluation
\item
{\tt optimize} for energy minimization
\item
{\tt dynamics} for molecular dynamics simulations and single step
thermodynamic perturbation free energy molecular dynamics simulations
\item
{\tt thermodynamics} for combined multi-configuration thermodynamic
integration and multiple step thermodynamic perturbation free
energy molecular dynamics simulations.
\end{description}

\section{System specification}

The chemical system for a calculation is specified in the topology
and restart files. These files should be created using the utilities
\nwtop\ and \nwrst\ before a simulation can be performed.
The names of these files are determined from the required \verb+system+ 
directive.

\begin{verbatim}
system <string systemid>_<string calcid>
\end{verbatim}

where the strings \verb+systemid+ and \verb+calcid+ are user defined names
for the chemical system and the type of calculation to ber performed, 
respectively. These names are used to derive the filenames used for the
calculation. The topoly file used will be \verb+systemid.top+, while all
other files are named \verb+systemid_calcid.ext+.

\section{Restarting and continuing simulations}
\begin{description}
\item
\begin{verbatim}

resume
\end{verbatim}

\section{Long range interaction corrections}
Long range electrostatic interactions are implemented using the
smooth particle mesh Ewald technique, for neutral periodic cubic systems in
the constant volume ensemble, using pair interaction potentials. Particle-mesh
Ewald long range interactions can only be used in molecular dynamics simulations
using effective pair potentials, and not in free energy simulations, QMD or
QM/MM simulations.

available, when \verb+imfft+ is set to 2. \verb+nprocs+ can be used to
define a subset of processors to be used to do the FFT calculations.

Keywrod \verb+center+
specifies the frequency \verb+<nfcntr>+ in molecular dynamics steps in 
which the center of geometry of the solute(s) is translated to the
center of the simulation volume. Optional keyword \verb+zonly+ or

directives. 
The default is not to record.

of the previous MD step, the wall clock time of the previous force
evaluation, the total synchronization time, the largest
synchronization time and the node on which the largest synchronization
time was found. The recording of synchronization times is part of the
load balancing algorithm. Since load balancing is only performed when

\section{Program control options}
\begin{description}
\item
\begin{verbatim}
load [reset] 
     ( none | 
       size [<real factld>] |
       sizez [<real factld>] | pairs | 
      (pairs [<integer ldpair>] size [<real factld>]) )
     [last]
     [minimum]
     [average]
     [combination]
     [iotime]
     [experimental]

\end{verbatim}
determines the type of dynamic load balancing performed,
where the default is {\tt none}. Load balancing option {\tt size}
is resizing cells on a node, and {\tt pairs} redistributes the
cell-cell interactions over nodes. Keyword \verb+reset+ will reset the
load balancing read from the restart file. The level of cell resizing
can be influenced with $factld$. The cells on the busiest node are
resized with a factor
\begin{equation}
\left( 1 - factld * { {T_{sync} \over n_p} - t^{min}_{sync} \over t_{wall}}
\right)^{1\over 3}
\end{equation}
where $T_{sync}$ is the accumulated synchronization time of all nodes,
$n_p$ is the total number of nodes, $t^{min}_{sync}$ is the synchronization
time of the busiest node, and $t_{wall}$ is the wall clock time of the
molecular dynamics step.
For the combined load balancing, \verb+ldpair+ is the number of successive pair 
redistribution load balancing steps in which the accumulated synchronization
time increases, before a resizing load balancing step will be attempted.
Load balancing is only performed in molecular dynamics steps in which the
pair-list is updated. The default load balancing is equivalent to specifying\\
\begin{verbatim}
load pairs 10 size 0.75
\end{verbatim}
Keyword \verb+last+ specifies that the load balancing is based on the
synchronization times of the last step. This is the default.
Keyword \verb+average+ specifies that the load balancing is based on the
average synchronization times since the last load balancing step.
Keyword \verb+minimum+ specifies that the load balancing is based on the
minimum synchronization times since the last load balancing step.
Keywords \verb+combination+, \verb+iotime+ and \verb+experimental+ are
experimental load balancing options that should not be used in
production runs.

\item
\begin{verbatim}
(pack | nopack)
\end{verbatim}
specifies if data are communicated in packed or unpacked form. The
default is \verb+pack+.

\item
\begin{verbatim}
procs <integer npx> <integer npy> <integer npz>
\end{verbatim}
specifies the distribution of the available processors over the three 
Cartesian dimensions. The default distribution is chosen such that, 
\verb+<npx>+$*$\verb+<npy>+$*$\verb+<npz>+=\verb+<np>+
and \verb+<npx>+ $<=$ \verb+<npy>+ $<=$ \verb+<npz>+, 
where \verb+<npx>+, \verb+<npy>+ and \verb+<npz>+ are the processors in the
\verb+x+, \verb+y+ and \verb+z+ dimension respectively, and \verb+<np>+ is the number of processors
allocated for the calculation. Where more than one combination
of \verb+<npx>+, \verb+<npy>+ and \verb+<npz>+ are possible, the 
combination is chosen with the minimum value of 
\verb+<npx>+$+$\verb+<npy>+$+$\verb+<npz>+. To change the default setting
the following optional input option is provided.

\item
\begin{verbatim}
cells <integer nbx> <integer nby> <integer nbz>
\end{verbatim}
specifies the distribution of cells,
where \verb+<nbx>+, \verb+<nby>+ and \verb+<nbz>+ are the number of
cells in \verb+x+, \verb+y+ and \verb+z+ direction, respectively.
The molecular system is decomposed into cells that form the smallest
unit for communication of atomic data between nodes. The size of the
cells is per default set to the short-range cutoff radius. If
long-range cutoff radii  are used the cell size is set to half the
long-range cutoff radius if it is larger than the short-range cutoff.
If the number of cells in a dimension is less than the number of
processors in that dimension, the number of cells is set to the number
of processors.

\item
\begin{verbatim}
extra <integer madbox>
\end{verbatim}
sets the number of additional cells for which memory is allocated.
In rare events the amount of memory set aside per node is insufficient
to hold all atomic coordinates assigned to that node. This leads to 
execution which aborts with the message that {\tt mwm} or {\tt msa} is too
small. Jobs may be restarted with additional space allocated by
where \verb+<madbox>+ is the number of additional cells that are allocated
on each node. The default for \verb+<madbox>+ is 6. 
In some cases \verb+<madbox>+ can be reduced to 4 if memory usage is a
concern. Values of 2 or less will almost certainly result in memory 
shortage.

\item
\begin{verbatim}
mwm <integer mwmreq>
\end{verbatim}
sets the maximum number of solvent molecules \verb+<mwmreq>+ per node,
allowing increased memory to be allocated for solvent molecules. This
option can be used if execution aborted because \verb+mwm+ was too
small.

\item
\begin{verbatim}
msa <integer msareq>
\end{verbatim}
sets the maximum number of solute atoms \verb+<msareq>+ per node,
allowing increased memory to be allocated for solute atoms. This
option can be used if execution aborted because \verb+msa+ was too
small.

\item
\begin{verbatim}
mcells <integer mbbreq>
\end{verbatim}
sets the maximum number of cell pairs \verb+<mbbreq>+ per node,
allowing increased memory to be allocated for the cell pair lists. 
This option can be used if execution aborted because \verb+mbbl+ was too
small.

\item
\begin{verbatim}
boxmin <real rbox>
\end{verbatim}
sets the minimum size of a cell. This directive is obsolete. The
use of mcells is preferred.

\item
\begin{verbatim}
segmentsize <real rsgm>
\end{verbatim}
sets the maximum size of a segment. This value is used to determine
which segments at the boundary of the cutoff radius should be considered
in the generation of the pairlists. This value is also determined by the
prepare module and written to the restart file. Use of this directive
is not needed for simulations that use the current prepare module to
generate the restart file.

\item
\begin{verbatim}
memory <integer memlim>
\end{verbatim}
sets a limit \verb+<memlim>+ in kB on the allocated amount of memory used by 
the molecular dynamics module.
Per default all available memory is allocated. Use of this command
is required for QM/MM simulations only.

\item
\begin{verbatim}
expert
\end{verbatim}
enables the use of certain combinations of features that are considered
unsafe. This directive should not be used for production runs.

\item
\begin{verbatim}
develop <integer idevel>
\end{verbatim}
enables the use of certain development options specified by the
integer \verb+idevel+. This option is for development purposes only,
and should not be used for production runs.
