NWChem provides many methods to compute the properties of molecular and
periodic systems using standard quantum mechanical descriptions of the
electronic wavefunction or density.  In addition, NWChem has the
capability to perform classical molecular dynamics and free energy
simulations.  These approaches may be combined to perform mixed
quantum-mechanics and molecular-mechanics simulations. 

NWChem is available on almost all high performance computing platforms,
workstations, PCs running LINUX, as well as clusters of desktop platforms or
workgroup servers. NWChem development has been devoted to providing
maximum efficiency on massively parallel processors. It achieves this performance
on the 1960 processors HP Itanium2 system in the EMSL's MSCF.  
It has not been optimized for high performance on single processor desktop systems.

\section{Molecular electronic structure}

The following quantum mechanical methods are available to calculate
energies, analytic first derivatives and second derivatives with respect to atomic
coordinates.  

\begin{itemize}
\item Self Consistent Field (SCF) or Hartree Fock (RHF, UHF).
\item Gaussian Density Functional Theory (DFT), using many local,
  non-local (gradient-corrected), and hybrid (local, non-local, and HF)

(spin-restricted)
with formal $N^3$ and $N^4$ scaling.
