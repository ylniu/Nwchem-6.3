# SVN_EXPAND_ID
# =============
#
# CVS and SVN both have the capability to insert useful information on checkin
# by expanding keywords. Of interest here is the "Id" keyword which adds 
# information like the name of the file, the revision number, the date and time
# of the checkin, and the user account the file was checked in from.
#
# The big difference between CVS and SVN is that CVS always expands certain
# keywords, but SVN does not expand any keywords unless you specify that it
# should. The latter is specified by setting the property svn:keywords to 
# the specific keywords you want it to expand. This needs to be specified for
# every file separately. This also implies that every time a file is added to
# the code that has the Id keyword in it this property must be set explicitly
# for that file. As this is likely to be forgotten it seemed opportune to 
# provide this script. 
#
# The obvious assumption here is that setting a property to the same value as
# before will not result in change and hence the file will not be checked in on
# a following commit. So every time this script is run only new files or files
# which have newly acquired the Id keyword will be modified and checked in.
#
# ** Note from experience: For this kind of modification SVN (version 1.6.2
#    (r37639)) needs about 1MB of memory per file. So checking 1000 files in at
#    once requires 1GB of memory. So if many files have been modified you may
#    need to check the changes in in batches, rather than attempting to check
#    everything in at once.
#
# To address all files within NWChem this script has to be run in the
# directory indicated by the NWCHEM_TOP environment variable. I.e. it finds 
# files only in the directory from where it is run and all sub-directories.
#
# The find command is build up as follows:
#
# -- ! -name "*.svn-base"
#
#    Find only those files with names that do not end in "svn-base". Files with
#    names ending in "svn-base" are copies of the source code that live in .svn
#    directories and are therefore part of the SVN data. Hence they should not
#    be messed with as that would likely result in errors.
#
# -- -exec grep "Id:" {} \;
#
#    Find only those files that contain the string "Id:" as the keyword of 
#    interest has no effect on any other files.
#
# -- -exec svn propset svn:keywords "Id" {} \;
#
#    Set the keyword property to "Id" so SVN will subsequently expand that 
#    keyword. More information on these keywords can be found at
#    http://svnbook.red-bean.com/ .
#
find . ! -name "*.svn-base" -exec grep "Id:" {} \; -exec svn propset svn:keywords "Id" {} \; -print
