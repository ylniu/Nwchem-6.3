NWChem compiles and links successfully for solaris 5.4 here at PNL.

Running NWChem:

There are a couple of caveats for execution on Solaris.  If you do not
have a fortran compiler you will need to have access to the runtime
libraries from FORTRAN.  This path must be in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH for
execution.  

Furthermore, since some functionality is distinguesed as the standard
system V environment and the BSD compatable environment you must also
include /usr/ucblib for the BSD functionality used in NWChem and
associated tools.  Again, this path must be in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  

On PNL's solaris configured suns add

setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /msrc/apps/SUNWspro/lib:/usr/ucblib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

to your .cshrc or equivalent to .profile etc.  

Building NWChem: 

To build NWChem you must have gcc, gnu make, and standard SUN f77 3.0
or later for Solaris.  You will most likely want to add the following 
to your path at PNL  (Offsite users must ask their system
administrator for proper information):

set path=(/msrc/apps/SUNWspro/SC3.0.1/bin /msrc/apps/SUNWspro/bin $path)
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /msrc/apps/SUNWspro/lib:/usr/ucblib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
setenv LM_LICENSE_FILE /msrc/share/etc/license.dat

This will allow the compilation, link, and execution of NWChem.
