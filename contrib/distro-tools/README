DISTRO TOOLS
============

In this directory some tools are provided to help generate binary
distributions of NWChem. 

gen_default.nwchemrc

    This script will generate the default nwchemrc file on a users
    machine. This goes into the directory ${target}/etc.

build_nwchem_bin_distro

    This script takes as a command line argument the directory name
    were the source code distribution lives. It expects 
    gen_default.nwchemrc to sit next to this directory and expects
    to be run from that directory. It will then create a directory
    for the binary and the suplemental material, copy all relevant
    material into it, and generate the various archives.

    Example: In the directory nwchem_releases we have:

       ./nwchem-6.0-linux/
       ./gen_default.nwchemrc
       ./build_nwchem_bin_distro

    We can then run:

       ./build_nwchem_bin_distro nwchem-6.0-linux

    After which the directory will contain:

       ./nwchem-6.0-linux/
       ./gen_default.nwchemrc
       ./build_nwchem_bin_distro
       ./nwchem-6.0-binary/
       ./nwchem-6.0-binary.tgz
       ./nwchem-6.0-binary.MANIFEST
       ./nwchem-6.0-binary.tar.bz2

build_nwchem

    This script sets up a set of environment variables and builds 
    NWChem accordingly. I can easily be adapted to any particular build
    of interest. At present it is set up to build a statically linked
    executable with the GNU compilers.
