# ! RJH ... This utility should no longer be necessary (10/95)
#
# This utility should safley find all files with 
# a particular include file and set things up for 
# a normal make pass.  It is very conservative.  
#
# RA Kendall PNL 4/95
#
# flaws: 
#    1) trashes all includes 
#    2) recompiles global
#    3) recompiles part tcgmsg
