1. To compile set evironmental variable FC to your Fortran90 compiler 
    (.eg. setenv FC gfortran) and run make
2. To run type
   ./amber-helper
3. The program expects AMBER parameters to be in amber.in file 
   (see included amber.in.ref for example). No fixed formatting is assumed and
   lines prefixed by # will be ignored (see example file)
4. NWChem parameter file will be generated in amber.par. 
   If amber.par is present prior to run, the code will issue an error.
5. For information regarding units for NWChem amber.par file see enclosed
