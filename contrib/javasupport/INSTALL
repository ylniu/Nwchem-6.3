To run the java support tool you need to have java 1.1.X since the tool
is based on that version of the java.awt event handling.  This tool
allows users to attach input, output, and one other file (e.g., error
file on an IBM SP) without "cutting and pasting"

The tool also works with java 1.2 but we still see bugs in this 
environment regarding color maps and window positions (but it works).

put all the *.class and *.gif files in the distribution in the
appropriate place on your system e.g., /usr/local/lib/classes

Add this path to your CLASSPATH; 
e.g., setenv CLASSPATH /usr/local/lib/classes:${CLASSPATH}

run it via java:  e.g., java NWChem

You can have a file $HOME/nwchemsupport that contains your preferred
email address if you already have a $HOME/.forward you can link to
this file using: ln -s $HOME/.forward $HOME/nwchemsupport With these
settings the java tool will automatically fill in the "From:" field on
the form when it comes up.


Enclosed in this distribution is a csh wrapper that can be used as
well, "report_nwchem" which when properly configured will allow the
user to exist in a non-java environement but still get access to the
form, i.e., report_nwchem sets up the java environement, runs the java
application and then exits.

If you have problems with this please contact via normal email:
nwchem-support@emsl.pnl.gov
