ROBODOC README
==============

This directory contains experimental material to generate source code 
documentation using Robodoc.

To generate the source code documentation run

	cd $NWCHEM_TOP
	./contrib/robodoc/run_robodoc

After this $NWCHEM_TOP/srcdoc.html should contain the source code documentation
of all of NWChem. As currently very few (i.e. no) files contain the appropriate
comments that Robodoc recognizes this file will be small.

Experience so far has shown Robodoc to be stable and capable to handle a 
large code. How the tool will behave if a large fraction of the source code
is documented is unknown.

For more details on Robodoc see:
