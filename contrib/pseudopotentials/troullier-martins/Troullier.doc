I. Explanation of the purpose of the programs.

In order to do ab initio calculations with manageably small basis sets,
particularly when a plane-wave basis is used, it is enormously helpful
to have already solved the quantum problem for the "core" electrons in
the atoms of the system. That is what a pseudopotential is designed to do.
The underlying assumption is that the "core" electrons do not change
their eigenstates between the different environments in which you might
be using the pseudopotential - this is part of what is termed the
"transferrability" issue (whether the same pseudopotential is appropriate
for many different environments).

The "troul51" (or "atm") code here does a calculation of the electronic
structure of the atom, assuming spherical symmetry of the electron charge
density. The calculation is currently done in the local density approximation:
for optimum transferrability the same exchange-correlation approximation
should be used in the pseudopotential code and in the ab initio code
which uses that pseudopotential, but currently other xc methods are
not implemented in this pseudopotential code. Then the code generates
what are called "semilocal" potentials - basically it starts by
making a good (norm-conserving, smooth) approximation (the
pseudo-wavefunctions) to the valence wavefunctions, and then inverts
the Schrodinger equation to derive a potential appropriate for
each angular-momentum value.

The "troul46" (or "kbconv") code takes the output from the "atm" code and
applies the "Kleinman-Bylander" decomposition to it, converting the
semi-local potentials into one local potential and "separable"
non-local terms on a radial grid. These are then tested for
the existence of "ghost states", and printed out in several formats
including one suitable for input to our ab initio code.

==========INPUT FILES FOR TROUL51====================

1. The "atom.dat" file
	- specifies the chemical species, the orbitals to be treated
	as valence and core, the type of pseudopotential to generate,
	and the occupations of the atomic orbitals

Note that the vertical column in which input parameters are given is
crucial in this and the other input files - always start with a
working input file and modify it, and don't introduce extra space
characters etc. See troul3.data for samples for all the elements.

Line 1:
   pg      Hydrogen
	- "pg" means generate a pseudopotential (other option: ae = all elec)
	- "Hydrogen is the name of the element... (actually an ignored comment)
---------
Line 2:
        tm2
	- The type of pseudopotential (Troullier-Martins type 2)
---------
Line 3:
 n=H  c=ca
	- Here we specify the element by 1 or 2-character standard name.
	- ca => Ceperley-Alder exchange-correlation
		(for heavier elements, this might be car or cas for
		relativistic or spin-dependent LDA)
---------
Line 4:
       0.0       0.0       0.0       0.0       0.0       0.0
        - Parameters that control the logarithmic radial grid, and some
	other stuff. Values of zero mean to use the defaults. See the
	code for details...
---------
Line 5:
    0    4
	- First integer is number of core l-values, second is number of
	  valence l-values to use in the pseudopotential generation.
	  The second number might as well always be 4 here.
	  For H and He, the core number is 0. For first row elements
	  the core row is 1 (for 1s). For second row, 3 (1s, 2s, 2p). Etc.
---------
Lines 6-9 (if 4 valence orbitals used):
    1    0     1.00      0.00
    2    1     0.00      0.00
    3    2     0.00      0.00
    4    3     0.00      0.00
        First number = "n" value, second number = "l" value for this
	valence wavefunction (ie. here we have 1s, 2p, 3d, 4f listed)
	third and fourth numbers are the occupations of "up" and "down"
	orbitals respectively. Just occupy the "up" orbitals unless you
	are doing a spin-dependent or relativistic calculation.
---------
Line 10:
   1.25     1.25     1.25     1.25
	- The "core radius" values to use, for the s, p, d and f valence
	wavefunctions. These are the distances in Bohr radii beyond which
	the pseudowavefunction is required to be an exact match to the
	true (all-electron) wavefunction. The principle requirement
	is that they MUST be greater than the highest node in the
	true wavefunction, and they should also be less than or similar
	to the last peak in the true wavefunction. Also, the larger
	these values are, the smaller the plane-wave cutoff required.
	Larger values are better computationally, but generally
	less transferrable.
---------
Line 11:

	- a blank line is required at the end or the code will crash!

=========

2. pseudo.dat (empty file) - ignore this. In fact, you will need
     to over-write it with the pseudo.dat01 file.

=========

3. pseudo.dat01
      -- contains the semi-local pseudopotentials in binary format.
	Don't try editing it unless you know what you're doing!

=========

4. plot.dat (empty file) - ignore this file.

=========

5. plot.dat01
      -- contains 2-column format "plots" for:
	True wavefunctions for s, p, d, f (wst, wpt, wdt, wft)
	Pseudowavefunctions for s, p, d, f (wsp, wpp, wdp, wfp)
	The semi-local pseudopotentials: vns, vnp, vnd, vnf
      And some mysterious other data (the fn's)
The simple c-program plotplot.c will select out of the plot.dat01 file
one or more of these (and when piped to axis and a UNIX plot filter will
produce graphics for you right away).
 
     It's a good idea to look at these wavefunctions and potentials
whenever you run this code. In particular, the maximum change
in the semi-local potentials and the range over which the valence
wavefunctions vary rapidly gives you a good picture of the
size of plane-wave cutoff you may need for this element.


==========INPUT FILES FOR TROUL46====================
1. kb.dat
	- Control parameters for the K-B code (again, columns matter, so
		be careful not to add space characters!)
Line 1:
local 1    0   0.00000  0.50
	- first number is which l to treat as the local pseudopotential.
	Usually, the best choice for this is the highest l you think
	needs to be treated at all (then all the lower l's require
	the nonlocal K-B decomposition, but this highest l is treated
	as local in the code). Here we are choosing to use p as the
	local potential, which means that s is the only nonlocal l value.
	Note that both the "p" and "s" semi-local potentials go into
	this pseudopotential, so it is not at all ignoring the scattering
	properties needed for p-type wavefunctions. In fact it will treat
	the p ones best! Effectively, the assumption is that all higher
	l's have potentials that look essentially the same as the p potential.

Remaining numbers are related to a method for correcting for
ghost states. Warning: this correction modifies the local potential,
so you should increase the lmax you print by 1, and use a llocal that
is also higher by 1 (in the current case, lmax = 2, and llocal = 2).

--- This one is ok. If there WAS a ghost state present, a warning
message would have been printed... Then this pseudopotential is
no good and you'll have to try again with different input parameters...
First try modifying the cutoff radii you are using. Then try
using a different "llocal". Then try increasing the maximum l by one,
and set llocal to the new highest l value. If none of these work, try
modifying the local potential with those extra input parameters
in kb.dat.
