This is a solvent only NWChem run

NWChem input files:
meoh.nw  - nwchem input deck
meoh.pdb - EMPTY pdb file, to fool nwchem
meoh.rst - restart file - same as scr/data/solvents/meoh.rst

NWChem output files:
meoh.top
meoh.seq
meoh_out.pdb - This is a PDB file of the resulting structure
meoh.out
meoh.nam
meoh_em.rst
meoh.db
meoh.bsg

Result:
Expect a 5780 line PDB file that starts like
CRYST1   42.476   42.476   42.476  90.00  90.00  90.00
Note that this is not a test of a result, it is a functionality test
