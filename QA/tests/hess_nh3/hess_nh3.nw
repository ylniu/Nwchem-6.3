# This input tests the accuracy of the finite difference
# MP2 hessian.  The original calculation was compared with
# analytic results supplied by the original reporter of
# the problem.  The lowest frequency computed by NWChem 3.2.1
# differed only by 0.1 wavenumbers whereas the highest differed
# only by 0.02 wavenumbers.

# On the IBM SP it took 5600s on 27 nodes.
