This output has been verified via external chemistry codes.  The
energies and gradients are correct.

This test case does the energy and gradient of H2CO in a dz+++ like
basis set.  The goal of this test case is that all valid integral and
integral derivative paths are checked.  As integral pathways open up
new specific test cases should be added to the input/output.  The
input file preamble describes the options covered by this input deck.
