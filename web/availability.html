  At the time of writing the current version of NWChem was <I>1.2
alpha</I>.  We do not plan to distribute the alpha or beta versions of
NWChem except to formal collaborators with specific needs.  When the
distribution policy changes it will be widely announced.  Until then,
if

<UL> 

<LI> you have an existing collaboration with EMSL staff, or 

<LI> you are interested in developing parallel computational chemistry
software within or around NWChem, and

<LI> have independent access to parallel computing resources, and

<LI> are able to share the results of your work with others, </UL>

then please contact your collaborators at PNNL or <A
HREF="support/support.html">nwchem-support@emsl.pnl.gov</A> for more
information.
