<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">NWChem 3.3.1 Functionality and Capabilities</P>
</B>
<P>NWChem provides many methods to compute the properties of molecular and periodic systems by using standard quantum mechanical descriptions of the electronic wavefunction or density.  In addition, NWChem has the capability to perform classical molecular dynamics and free energy simulations.  These approaches may be combined to perform mixed quantum-mechanics and molecular-mechanics simulations. </P>
<P>NWChem is available on almost all high performance computing platforms, workstations, PCs running LINUX, as well as clusters of desktop platforms or workgroup servers. NWChem development has been devoted to providing maximum efficiency on massively parallel processors.  It achieves this performance on the 512 node IBM SP system in the EMSL's <a href="http://www.emsl.pnl.gov/pub/mscf">MSCF</a> and on the 512 node CRAY T3E-900 system in the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center.  It has not been optimized for high performance on single processor desktop systems.</P>
