<h1>NWChem 5.0 Functionality and Capabilities</h1>    
      <br>
      <p>NWChem provides many methods to compute the properties of
molecular and
periodic systems using standard quantum mechanical descriptions of the
electronic wavefunction or density. In addition, NWChem has the
capability to perform classical molecular dynamics and free energy
simulations. These approaches may be combined to perform mixed
quantum-mechanics and molecular-mechanics simulations. </p>
      <p>NWChem is available on almost all high performance computing
platforms,
workstations, PCs running LINUX, as well as clusters of desktop
platforms or
workgroup servers. NWChem development has been devoted to providing
maximum efficiency on massively parallel processors. It achieves this
performance
on the 1960 processors HP Itanium2 system in the EMSL's MSCF. It has
not been optimized for high performance on single processor desktop
systems.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
