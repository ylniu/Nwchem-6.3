NWChem is a computational chemistry package that is designed to run on
high-performance parallel supercomputers as well as conventional workstation
clusters. It aims to be scalable both in its ability to treat large problems
efficiently, and in its usage of available parallel computing resources.
NWChem has been developed by the Molecular Sciences Software
group of the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL) at the
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). Most of the implementation
has been funded by the EMSL Construction Project.

<B>Report NWChem Meeting Available Online</b>
<br><br>
The report developed from the NWChem Meeting on Science Driven Petascale Computing and Capability Development at EMSL, 
held in January 2007 is now available <a href="NWCHEM_EMSL_Meeting_Report.pdf">online</a>. 
<br><br>
The NWChem development strategy is focused on providing new and essential scientific capabilities to EMSL users and 
enabling innovative and integrated research at EMSL, while at the same time effectively utilizing the latest computing 
technology on supercomputers hundreds of teraflops and tens of thousands of processors in size. Scientific capability 
areas that will be developed in NWChem are aligned with 
<a href=http://www.emsl.pnl.gov/proj/science_themes.shtml">EMSL's science themes</a>. <br><br>
As such, the development strategy for the next 5 years will be two-fold:
<ol>
<li>Enable NWChem to push the scientific envelope by scaling the software to petaflop architectures.  An improved 
software architecture that can effectively utilize the hardware advances and tens to hundreds of thousands of 
processors anticipated in the next 10 years will be designed and developed.</li>
<li>Develop new and essential cutting-edge capabilities that enable research to answer scientific questions in the 
areas of 1) kinetics and dynamics of chemical transformations, 2) chemistry at interfaces and in the condensed phase, 
and 3) spanning longer time regimes with molecular dynamics.</li>
</ol>
These two development areas are not independent of each other, as new capabilities often involve new types of algorithms 
that may be able to exploit the petascale architectures in different ways than the traditional quantum chemistry and 
molecular dynamics methodologies.
<br><br>
Details on the meeting, including slides from presentations and Live Stream Recordings of Meeting Presentations, are 
available on the <a href="http://www.emsl.pnl.gov/nwchemmeeting/">NWChem Meeting website</a>.

<B>Announcing NWChem-5.1
</b>
<br><br>
The NWChem development team is pleased to announce the release of NWChem version
5.1. This release includes a number of new capabilities, new supported platforms
and bug fixes.  Major highlights in this release include:
<br>
<br>

<h3> Available on latest platforms: </h3>
<ul>
NWChem now supports the IBM BlueGene/L and the Cray XT3/XT4 (Compute Node Linux)
platforms with the computational scalability of up to at least 1024 processors on the IBM BlueGene/L, and up to 1024 processors on the Cary XT3/XT4. In addition, the Infiniband/OpenIB network is also supported.
</ul>

<h3> New accurate energetics and properties calculations: </h3>
<ul>
A coupled-cluster linear response is now available using both restricted and
unrestricted references. Ground-state dynamic polarizabilities at the
coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and triples levels of theory are now
available. Second order approximate coupled-cluster model with singles and
doubles (CC2) is available for excited states. In addition, performance
improvements have been made in both time-to-solution and memory usage.
</ul>

<h3> Better modeling of heavy element chemistry: </h3>
<ul>
The new spin-orbit zeroth-order relativistic approximation (ZORA) is available
in both the Gaussian and plane wave density functional theory modules, providing
a framework for heavy element chemistry simulations. In addition, the spin-orbit
Douglas-Kroll approach is now available.
</ul>

<h3> New science possible with plane wave module: </h3>
<ul>
Fermi smearing to model metals had been added in the NWChem Plane Wave module. In
addition, the plane wave module can now handle any general pseudopotential, and
performance improvements enable faster time-to-solution and improved scalability.
</ul>

<h3> Users contribute new capabilities to NWChem: </h3>
<ul>
The constrained density functional theory method developed by the Van Voorhis
Group is now available. In addition, the Truhlar group has made their latest M06
density functional available in NWChem.
</ul>

A full list of new capabilities and changes is available in the release notes

The suite utilizes parallel-programming tools developed by PNNL staff.
Most of the tool and scalable algorithm development has been funded by the
High Performance Computing and Communications Initiative (HPCCI)
grand-challenge software program and the <a href="http://acts.nersc.gov" target="_blank">
DOE-2000 ACTS Tools</a> project.
