<h1>NWChem Version 4.7 Notes</h1>

<p>
<font color="red">NOTE:</font> These release notes are not a substitute for reading the
<a href="../doc/user/userpdf.pdf">User Manual</a>! They are meant to give a
thumbnail sketch of the new capabilities and bug fixes that are available in
NWChem version 4.7. When there is a conflict between the release notes and the
<a href="../doc/user/userpdf.pdf">User Manual</a>, the User Manual takes precedence.

<p>
The changes for version 4.7 are listed at the bottom of this file.

<b><h2>Several new major capabilities are available in NWChem, including a new module.</h2></b>
<p>
A completely new QM/MM module that interfaces between classical molecular mechanics and quantum
mechanical modules is now available in NWChem.  The user is referred to the  <a href="../doc/user/userpdf.pdf">User
Manual</a> for more information. </p>

<h3>Additional major additions to the capabilities include:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Properties module expanded with additional NMR properties for both SCF and DFT:
 <ul>
 <li>Hyperfine coupling (Fermi-Contact and Spin-Dipole expectation values)
 <li>Indirect spin-spin coupling
 <li>Shielding now also available for DFT wave functions
 </ul>
<li>Task property now requires the specification of the theory (scf or dft), making the
  calculation of properties a single task instead of two (task scf; task property)
<li>Ability to use driver for optimization and transition states search for quantum region
<li>Self-consistent evaluation of metaGGA energies have been implemented in the DFT module.
<li>Prototype PBE0 exchange-correlation functional and Hartree-Fock (xc= pbe0, hf) added to PSPW
</ul>
<p>Again, for each of these capabilities, the user is referred to the <a href="../doc/user/userpdf.pdf">User Manual</a>
for more information. </p>

<p>Listed below are the other major and many minor changes for each module
with significant changes. These descriptions are somewhat terse and more
information is generally available in the <a href="../doc/user/userpdf.pdf">User Manual</a>.</p>

<p>

</ul>

<p>
<p>
<h3>QMMM:</h3>
<ul>
