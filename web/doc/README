The prog and user trees are automatically generated by latex2html and
any edits down there will be lost.  The searching capability is
manually pasted into the {user,prog}.html files from stuff checked
into CVS in nwchem/doc.  The csh scripts {user,prog}_body are executed
from this directory and munge the backgrounds of the many pages in the
subdirectories.
