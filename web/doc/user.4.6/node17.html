15.1 Overview</A>
</H1>

<P>
The Tensor Contraction Engine (TCE) Module of NWChem implements 
a variety of approximations that converge at the exact solutions
of Schr&#246;dinger equation.  They include configuration interaction theory
through singles, doubles, triples, and quadruples substitutions,
coupled-cluster theory through connected singles, doubles, triples, and quadruples substitutions,
and many-body perturbation theory through fourth order in its 
tensor formulation.  Not only optimized parallel programs of some
of these high-end correlation theories are new, but also the way in
which they have been developed is unique.  The working equations
of all of these methods have been derived completely automatically by
a symbolic manipulation program called a Tensor Contraction Engine (TCE),
and the optimized parallel programs have also been computer-generated by the same program,
which were interfaced to NWChem.  The development of the TCE
program and this portion of the NWChem program has been financially 
supported by the United States Department of Energy, Office of Science,
Office of Basic Energy Science, through the SciDAC program.

<P>
The capabilities of the module include:

<UL>
<LI>Restricted Hartree-Fock, unrestricted Hartree-Fock, and restricted open-shell
Hartree-Fock references,
</LI>
<LI>Restricted KS DFT and unrestricted KS DFT references,
</LI>
<LI>Unrestricted configuration interaction theory (CISD, CISDT, and CISDTQ),
</LI>
<LI>Unrestricted coupled-cluster theory (LCCD, CCD, LCCSD, CCSD, QCISD, CCSDT, CCSDTQ),
</LI>
<LI>Unrestricted iterative many-body perturbation theory [MBPT(2), MBPT(3), MBPT(4)] in its tensor formulation,
</LI>
</UL>
New capabilities added in the version 4.6 are:

<UL>
<LI>Unrestricted coupled-cluster singles and doubles with perturbative connected triples {CCSD(T), CCSD[T]},
</LI>
<LI>Unrestricted equation-of-motion coupled-cluster theory (EOM-CCSD, EOM-CCSDT, EOM-CCSDTQ) for excitation energies, transition moments and oscillator strengths, and excited-state dipole moments,
</LI>
<LI>Unrestricted coupled-cluster theory (CCSD, CCSDT, CCSDTQ) for dipole moments.
</LI>
</UL>
Version 4.6 and onwards the distributed binary executables do not contain CCSDTQ and its
derivative methods, owing to their large volume.  The source code includes them, so a user
can reinstate them by <code>setenv CCSDTQ yes</code> and recompile TCE module.
The following optimizations have been used in the module:

<UL>
<LI>Spin symmetry (spin integration is performed wherever possible within the
unrestricted framework, making the present unrestricted program 
optimal for an open-shell system.  The spin adaption was not performed, 
although in a restricted calculation for a closed-shell system, certain spin blocks of 
integrals and amplitudes are further omitted by symmetry, and
consequently, the present unrestricted CCSD requires only twice
as many operations as a spin-adapted restricted CCSD for a closed-shell system),
</LI>
<LI>Point-group symmetry,
</LI>
<LI>Index permutation symmetry,
</LI>
<LI>Runtime orbital range tiling for memory management,
</LI>
<LI>Dynamic load balancing (local index sort and matrix multiplications) parallelism,
</LI>
<LI>Multiple parallel I/O schemes including fully incore algorithm using Global Arrays,
</LI>
<LI>Frozen core and virtual approximation.
</LI>
<LI>DIIS extrapolation and Jacobi update of excitation amplitudes
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
This extensible module is designed such that an existing or new model of many-electron
theory can be added and further optimization can be incorporated with ease 
by virtue of the TCE.
This module is still being
actively enhanced by the TCE and we hope to include more models and optimizations
in future releases!

15.3.1 Spin, spatial, and index permutation symmetry</A>
</H2>

<P>
The TCE thoroughly analyzes the working equation of many-electron theory models and 
automatically generates a program that takes full advantage of these symmetries at the same time.
To do so, the TCE first recognizes the index permutation symmetries among the working equations,
and perform strength reduction and factorization by carefully monitoring the index permutation
symmetries of intermediate tensors.  Accordingly, every input and output tensor (such as 
integrals, excitation amplitudes, residuals) has just two independent but strictly ordered index strings,
and each intermediate tensor has just four independent but strictly ordered index strings.
The operation cost and storage size of tensor contraction is minimized by using the index range 
restriction arising from these
index permutation symmetries and also spin and spatial symmetry integration.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION001732000000000000000">
15.3.2 Runtime orbital range tiling</A>
</H2>

<P>
To maintain the peak local memory usage at a manageable level, in the beginning of the calculation,
the orbitals are rearranged into tiles (blocks) that contains orbitals with the same spin and spatial
symmetries.  So the tensor contractions in these methods are carried out at the tile level; the spin,
spatial, and index permutation symmetry is employed to reduce the operation and storage cost at the tile 
level also.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION001733000000000000000">
15.3.3 Dynamic load balancing parallelism</A>

<P>
In a parallel execution, dynamic load balancing of tile-level local tensor index sorting and local 
tensor contraction (matrix multiplication) will be invoked.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION001734000000000000000">
15.3.4 Parallel I/O schemes</A>
</H2>

<P>
Each process is assigned a local tensor index sorting and tensor contraction dynamically.  It must first
retrieve the tiles of input tensors, and perform these local operations, and accumulate the output
tensors to the storage.  We have developed a uniform interface for these I/O operations to either
(1) a global file on a global file system, (2) a global memory on a global or distributed memory system,
and (3) semi-replicated files on a distributed file systems.  Some of these operations depend on 
the ParSoft library.

<P>
The keyword to invoke the many-electron theories in the module is
<code>TCE</code>.  To perform a single-point energy calculation, include
<PRE>
      TASK TCE ENERGY
</PRE>
in the input file, which may be preceeded by the TCE input block
that details the calculations:

</PRE>
Also supported are energy gradient calculation, geometry optimization,
and vibrational frequency (or hessian) calculation, on the basis of
numerical differentiation.  To perform these calculations, use
<PRE>
      TASK TCE GRADIENT
</PRE>
or
<PRE>
      TASK TCE OPTIMIZE
</PRE>
or
<PRE>
      TASK TCE FREQUENCIES
</PRE>

<P>
Alternatively, more descriptive keywords for each individual method can be used.
For instance, to perform a CCSDT energy, gradient, etc. calculation, use
<PRE>
      TASK UCCSDT ENERGY
</PRE>
or
<PRE>
      TASK UCCSDT GRADIENT
</PRE>
or
<PRE>
      TASK UCCSDT OPTIMIZE
</PRE>
or
<PRE>
      TASK UCCSDT FREQUENCIES
</PRE>
with an (optional) input block enclosed either by <code>UCCSDT</code> and <code>END</code> or
by <code>UCC</code> and <code>END</code>.  The keywords for individual methods of TCE module
always start with letter <code>U</code> which stands for ``unrestricted'' to avoid 
confusion with other related methods (such as spin-restricted CCSD and various 
canonical MP2 implementation) already in place in NWChem.
<PRE>
  (UCCSDT||UCC)
    [(DFT||HF||SCF) default HF=SCF]

</PRE>
When a method (CCSDT in this example) is specified in the task directive, 
a duplicate method specification
is not necessary (indeed not allowed) in the corresponding (<code>UCCSDT</code> or <code>UCC</code> in this case) 
input block.  The keywords of the other methods for task directive are:
<PRE>
      TASK (UCCD||ULCCD||UCCSD||ULCCSD||UQCISD||UCCSDT||UCCSDTQ) ENERGY
</PRE>
or
<PRE>
      TASK (UCISD||UCISDT||UCISDTQ) ENERGY
</PRE>
or
<PRE>
      TASK (UMP2||UMP3||UMP4||UMBPT2||UMBPT3||UMBPT4) ENERGY
</PRE>
etc.  The input block can be specified by the same name (<code>UCISDT</code> and <code>END</code>
block for <code>TASK UCISDT ENERGY</code>) or <code>UCC</code> for the CC family, <code>UCI</code> for 
the CI family, and <code>UMP</code> or <code>UMBPT</code> for the MP family of methods.

<P>
The user may also specify the parameters of reference wave function calculation
in a separate block for either HF (SCF) or DFT, depending on the first keyword
in the above syntax.

<P>
Since each keyword has a default value, a minimal input file will be

cost will be made.  Within the unrestricted framework, all these methods take full advantage
of spin, spatial, and index permutation symmetries to save operation and storage costs at every
stage of the calculation.  Consequently, these computer-generated programs will perform significantly
faster than, for instance, a hand-written spin-adapted CCSD program in NWChem, although the nominal 
operation cost for a spin-adapted CCSD is just one half of that for spin-unrestricted CCSD (in spin-unrestricted
CCSD there are three independent sets of excitation amplitudes, whereas in spin-adapted CCSD there
is only one set, so the nominal operation cost for the latter is one third of that of the former.  For 
a restricted reference wave function of a closed-shell system, all <IMG

<P>
While the MBPT (MP) models implemented in the TCE module give identical correlation energies as 
conventional implementation for a canonical HF reference of a closed-shell system, the former are intrinsically
more general and theoretically robust for other less standard reference wave functions and open-shell systems.
This is because the zeroth order of Hamiltonian is chosen to be the full Fock operatior (not just the diagonal
part), and no further approximation was invoked.  So unlike the conventional implementation where the Fock
matrix is assumed to be diagonal and a correlation energy is evaluated in a single analytical formula that involves
orbital energies (or diagonal Fock matrix elements), the present tensor MBPT requires the iterative solution
of amplitude equations and subsequent energy evaluation and is generally more expensive than the former.
For example, the operation cost of many conventional implementation of MBPT(2) scales as the fourth power 
of the system size, but the cost of the present tensor MBPT(2) scales as the fifth power of the system size,
as the latter permits non-canonical HF reference and the former does not (to reinstate the non-canonical HF 
reference in the former makes it also scale as the fifth power of the system size).

15.5.3 <TT>THRESH</TT> -- the convergence threshold of iterative solutions of amplitude equations</A>

<P>
This keyword specifies the convergence threshold of iterative solutions of amplitude equations,

The threshold refers to the norm of residual,
namely, the deviation from the amplitude equations.
The default value is <code>1e-6</code>.

15.5.5 <TT>IO</TT> -- parallel I/O scheme</A>
</H2>

<P>
There are five parallel I/O schemes implemented for all the models, which need to be
wisely chosen for a particular problem and computer architecture. 

<UL>
<LI><code>fortran</code> : Fortran77 direct access,
</LI>
<LI><code>eaf</code> : Exclusive Access File library,
</LI>
<LI><code>ga</code> : Fully incore, Global Array virtual file,
</LI>
<LI><code>sf</code> : Shared File library,
</LI>
<LI><code>replicated</code> : Semi-replicated file on distributed file system with EAF library.
</LI>
<LI><code>dra</code> : Distributed file on distributed file system with DRA library.
</LI>
<LI><code>ga_eaf</code> : Semi-replicated file on distributed file system with EAF library. GA is used 
to speedup the file reconciliation.
</LI>
</UL>
The GA algorithm, which is default, stores all input (integrals and
excitation amplitudes), output (residuals), and intermediate tensors in the shared memory area
across all nodes by virtue of GA library.  This fully incore algorithm replaces disk I/O by
inter-process communications.  This is a recommended algorithm whenever feasible.  Note that 
the memory management through runtime orbital range tiling described above applies to local
(unshared) memory of each node, which may be separately allocated from the shared memory space
for GA.  So when there is not enough shared memory space (either physically or due to software
limitations, in particular, shmmax setting), the GA algorithm can crash due to an out-of-memory error.
The replicated scheme is the currently the only disk-based algorithm for a genuinely distributed
file system.  This means that each node keeps an identical copy of input tensors and
it holds non-identical overlapping segments of intermediate and output tensors in its local disk.
Whenever data coherency is required, a file reconcilation process will take place to make the intermediate
and output data identical throughout the nodes.  This algorithm, while requiring redundant data space on
local disk, performs reasonably efficiently in parallel.  For sequential execution, this reduces 
to the EAF scheme.  For a global file system, the SF scheme is recommended.  This together with
the Fortran77 direct access scheme does not usually exhibit scalability unless shared files on
the global file system also share the same I/O buffer.  For sequential executions, the 
SF, EAF, and replicated schemes are interchangeable, while the Fortran77 scheme is appreciably
slower.

<P>
Two new I/O algorithms <code>dra</code> and <code>ga_eaf</code> combines GA and DRA or EAF based replicated 
algorithm.  In the former, arrays that are not active (e.g., prior <IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img127.gif"
 ALT="$T$"> amplitudes used in DIIS
or EOM-CC trial vectors) in GA algorithm will be moved to DRA.  In the latter, the intermediates
that are formed by tensor contractions are initially stored in GA, thereby avoiding the need to
accumulate the fragments of the intermediate scattered in EAFs in the original EAF algorithm.
Once the intermediate is formed completely, then it will be replicated as EAFs.

15.5.6 <TT>DIIS</TT> -- the convergence acceleration</A>
</H2>

<P>
It sets the number iterations in which a DIIS extrapolation is performed to accelerate
the convergence of excitation amplitudes.  The default value is 5, which means in every
five iteration, one DIIS extrapolation is performed (and in the rest of the iterations,
Jacobi rotation is used).  When zero or negative value is specified, the DIIS is turned
off.  It is not recommended to perform DIIS every iteration, whereas setting a large 
value for this parameter necessitates a large memory (disk) space to keep the excitation
amplitudes of previous iterations.

15.5.7 <TT>FREEZE</TT> -- the frozen core/virtual approximation</A>
</H2>

<P>
Some of the lowest-lying core orbitals and/or some of the highest-lying
virtual orbitals may be excluded in the calculations
by this keyword (this does not affect the ground state HF or DFT calculation).
No orbitals are frozen by default.  To exclude the atom-like
core regions altogether, one may request

To specify the number of lowest-lying occupied orbitals be excluded, one may use
<PRE>
  FREEZE 10

which causes 10 lowest-lying occupied orbitals excluded.
This is equivalent to writing
<PRE>
  FREEZE core 10

15.5.8 <TT>NROOTS</TT> -- the number of excited states</A>

<P>
One can specify the number of excited state roots to be determined.  The default
value is <code>1</code>.  It is advised that the users request several more roots than actually
needed, since owing to the nature of the trial vector algorithm, some low-lying
roots can be missed when they do not have sufficient overlap with the initial guess
vectors.

15.5.9 <TT>TARGET</TT> and <TT>TARGETSYM</TT> -- the target root and its symmetry</A>
</H2>

<P>
At the moment, the first and second geometrical derivatives of excitation
energies that are needed in force, geometry, and frequency calculations are
obtained by numerical differentiation.  These keywords may be used to specify
which excited state root is being used for the geometrical derivative calculation.
For instance, when <code>TARGET 3</code> and <code>TARGETSYM a1g</code> are included in the
input block, the total energy (ground state energy plus excitation energy)
of the third lowest excited state root (excluding the ground state) transforming as
the irreducible representation <code>a1g</code> will be passed to the module which performs
the derivative calculations.  The default values of these keywords are <code>1</code> and <code>none</code>,
respectively.

<P>
The keyword <code>TARGETSYM</code> is essential in excited state geometry
optimization, since it is very common that the order of excited states changes due to
the geometry changes in the course of optimization.  Without specifying the <code>TARGETSYM</code>,
the optimizer could (and would likely) be optimizing the geometry of an excited state that
is different from the one the user had intended to optimize at the starting geometry.
On the other hand, in the frequency calculations, <code>TARGETSYM</code> must be <code>none</code>,
since the finite displacements given in the course of frequency calculations will lift
the spatial symmetry of the equilibrium geometry.  When these finite displacements can
alter the order of excited states including the target state, the frequency calculation
is not be feasible.

15.5.10 <TT>SYMMETRY</TT> -- restricting the excited state symmetry</A>

By adding this keyword to the input block, the user can request the module to
seek just the roots of the specified irreducible representation as 
<code>TARGETSYM</code>.  By default, this option is not set.
<code>TARGETSYM</code> must be specified when <code>SYMMETRY</code> is invoked.

15.5.11 <TT>DIPOLE</TT> -- the ground- and excited-state dipole moments</A>

of iterative step for the so-called <IMG

density matrix and dipole moments.  Likewise, for excited-states (EOM-CC), the 
transition moments and dipole moments will be computed when (and only when) this
option is set.  In the latter case, EOM-CC left hand side solutions will be sought
incurring approximately three times the computational cost of excitation energies 
alone (note that the EOM-CC effective Hamiltonian is not Hermitian and has distinct
left and right eigenvectors).

15.5.12 <TT>(NO)FOCK</TT> -- (not) recompute Fock matrix</A>
</H2>

<P>
The default is <code>FOCK</code> meaning that the Fock matrix will
be reconstructed (as opposed to using the orbital energies as the diagonal part of
Fock).  This is essential in getting correct correlation energies with ROHF or DFT
reference wave functions.  However, currently, this module cannot reconstruct the
Fock matrix when one-component relativistic effects are operative.  So when a user
wishes to run TCE's correlation methods with DK or other relativistic reference,
<code>NOFOCK</code> must be set and orbital energies must be used for the Fock matrix.
