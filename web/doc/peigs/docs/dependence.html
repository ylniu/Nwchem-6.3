<H1>Dependence on other software</H1>

<P>
The current implementation of PeIGS communicates among processes using the 
<A href="/docs/global/tcgmsg.html"> TCGMSG </A>
portable message
passing library, except on Intel machines where it uses the native NX
message passing library.  PeIGS can use MPI, when available, in place
 of TCGMSG and Intel NX.

<P>
PeIGS also uses a number of BLAS and LAPACK
routines which are available via anonymous ftp from <EM>netlib.att.com</EM>.
All of the required BLAS and LAPACK routines are also supplied in  
the PeIGS distribution.
