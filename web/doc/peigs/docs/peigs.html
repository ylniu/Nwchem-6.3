<H1>PeIGS -- Parallel Eigensystem Solver </H1>

PeIGS is a scalable, fully parallel, implementation of a
generalized and standard real, symmetric, dense eigensystem
solver callable from both Fortran 77 and C.

Only double precision is currently supported.

<P>
PeIGS runs on a variety of parallel computer systems, including
networks of workstations, and can easily be ported to any machine
that supports the message passing programming model.

The current version of PeIGS utilizes the
<A href="/docs/global/tcgmsg.html"> TCGMSG </A>
portable
communication package, MPI, or Intel NX intrinsics.

<P>
PeIGS is being used at the
<A HREF="/docs/pnl.overview.html">
Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL) </A>
as a production-grade library package for the construction of scalable
<A HREF="/"> quantum
chemistry application programs</A>,
including parallel SCF, MCSCF, DFT, and MP2 methods.  Due to the
speed and scalability of PeIGS, the time for the eigensystem solution
has been reduced to an insignificant fraction of the total
time-to-solution for these applications.
