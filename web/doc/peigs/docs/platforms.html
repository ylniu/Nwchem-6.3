<H1>Platforms on which PeIGS runs</H1>

<P>
PeIGS is designed for parallel and distributed memory computers with a
relatively high startup time for communication.  PeIGS can also be run on
networks of workstations and shared memory computers using 
Robert Harrison's 
<A HREF="/docs/global/tcgmsg.html"> TCGMSG </A>
message passing software or using MPI.

<P>
PeIGS uses only blocking send & receive which are implemented in a portable
way.  Switching to different communications libraries, e.g., PVM, 
requires modifying only a few routines.

<HR>

PeIGS runs using the native message passing library on:
<UL>
<LI>Intel Delta, Paragon
</UL>

PeIGS currently runs using 
<A HREF="/docs/global/tcgmsg.html"> TCGMSG </A> on:

<UL>
<LI>IBM SP series
<LI>Cray T3D, T3E
<LI>KSR-2
<LI>SGI Power Challenge, Origins, Octanes
<LI>Network and cluster of workstations(Unix-like, linux)
</UL>

PeIGS runs using MPI on:
<UL>
<LI>Intel Delta, Paragon
<LI>IBM SP series
<LI>SGI Power Challenge, Origins, Octanes
<LI>Network of workstations(Unix-like)
</UL>

PeIGS can be run using MPI on other machines by making a simple change
to the machine specific parts of a single Makefile.
