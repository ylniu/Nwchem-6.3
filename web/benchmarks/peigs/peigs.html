<H1>PeIGS - Parallel Eigensolver</H1>

<H2>George I. Fann and Richard J. Littlefield</H2>

 <P> Our parallel eigensolver package is called PeIGS, and solves the
standard and generalized, real, symmetric eigenproblems.  It is based
on bisection for eigenvalues and repeated inverse iteration and
reorthogonalization for eigenvectors.  The parallel performance is
competitive with alternative methods for typical "chemical" problem sizes, and is
illustrated with three applications from quantum chemistry
<UL>
<LI> SCF-Hartree-Fock (Fock matrix for 389 atom zeolite fragment, 2053 functions)

<LI> density functional theory (charge-fitting matrix for <I>(SiOSi)6</I>, 1687)

<LI> resolution-of-the-identity Moller-Plesset theory (biphenyl
charge-fitting matrix, 966)
</UL>
The distinguishing feature of the repeated inverse iteration and
orthonormalization method used by PeIGS is that orthogonalization is
performed across multiple processors as dictated by the spectrum.
The correct, orthonormal result is <I>always</I> generated.

 <P>For a spectrum that is well spaced, there is essentially no
orthogonalization time.  Most of the time is consumed in the
Householder reduction to tridiagonal form.  For large numerically
degenerate clusters, almost all of the time is consumed in the
Householder reduction and in orthonormalization.
