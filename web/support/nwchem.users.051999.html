The next release of NWChem will be at the end of June, 1999 and will 
include the following features:<br>
<ul>
<li> Interface with Python,
<li> ECP bug with R to the power of zero fixed,
<li> ECP atomic guess is more robust,
<li> DFT uses faster Texas integrals and can use sphericals,
<li> Addition of Handy and BP97 DFT functionals,
<li> <i>autosym</i> capabilities,
<li> Use of constraints in geometry optimization,
<li> Addition of GIAO capabilities for NMR properties
    (up through g functions and only with cartesians),
<li> Calculation of Electrostatics with CHELP and RESP is more robust,
<li> Can send plot of electrostatic potential on a grid to a file for
     viewing with GOpenMol,
<li> MD analysis tools are improved,
<li> Car-Parrinello functionality,
<li> Linux build works with PGI compiler (default is EGCS with g77 and gcc 
     which works uder Slackware, RedHat and Debian), 
<li> DEC Unix is now available (there is a link problem work around), and
<li> Expanded <A HREF="NWChem_FAQ.html">FAQ page</A>.
</ul>
