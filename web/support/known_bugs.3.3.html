<h1>NWChem Known Bugs in version 3.3</h1>

It is recommended that users use the defaults in NWChem. 
They have been set to provide maximum efficiency for most users.
If you feel you must change one of the defaults, be aware that
you are responsible for ensuring that the results are correct.
<p>
Below is a list of the known bugs in NWChem 3.3 and 3.3.1.  If you believe
that you have found bugs that are not listed here, please
send your bug report using the correct channel listed in the
<a href="support.html">Reporting Problems with NWChem page</a>.

<font color="purple">Direct MP2 optimizations:</font>
<p>
MP2 optimizations that are performed with the direct option can
have problems with CPHF convergence.  In this case, the user is
advised to use the default options which is a semi-direct calculation.
<pre>

</pre>
<font color="purple">start, restart, and continue in the title:</font>
<p>
When the words start, restart, and continue appear at the beginning of the
title, NWChem erroneously picks them up when scanning for start, restart, 
and continue directives.  The work around is to not use these words in the title.
This will be fixed in the next major release.

<font color="purple">CCSD(T) energies are unstable on the IBMSP:</font>
<p>
CCSD(T) energies are unstable on the IBMSP using the LAPI
version.  The error that the user will see are 
jobs that just hang.  We are working to solve this problem.
<font color="red">This is improved in version 3.3.1, but may still occur.</font>

</pre>
<font color="purple">Occasional restart file corruption in PREPARE module</font>
<p>
In some systems, when converting a restart file to a PDB
file, the restart file gets corrupted.  We are working to solve this
problem. <font color="red">This is now fixed in version 3.3.1</font>
<pre>

<font color="purple">Possible problems with pgf77 Version 1.7 compiled binaries:
   especially using AUTOZ</font>
<p>
We have tested with pgf77 Version 1.7 and have found that our
automatic z-matrix code (AUTOZ in the GEOMETRY group) hangs but other 
functionality works.  Since AUTOZ is the default, you will need to change
the GEOMETRY group to contain NOAUTOZ.
The pgf77 version has not been robustly tested and therefore, other problems
may be encountered.<p>
Although we have not tested this, we have been told that pgf77 version 3.1
fixes this problem.

<font color="purple">Slow parallel performance between Linux boxes</font>
<p>
With Linux kernels earlier than 2.2.x, there is a significant slow down when
sending messages between Linux boxes.  We have added some fixes to help alleviate
this problem, but the best solution is to upgrade your kernel.
<p>
There is also a kernel <a href="http://www.icase.edu/coral/LinuxTCP.html">
patch</a> which helps to cut down  latency in the TCP/IP socket based 
communication on the Linux clusters
connected with Ethernet networks. We  strongly recommend people to apply 
the patch to avoid communication performance problems.

<font color="purple">Different number of iterations to find the total energy when
      using different number of processors on the Cray-T3E.</font>
<p>
This behavior can be seen when there are large numbers of degeneracies in
the eigenvalues.  So far we have not had a case that gives the wrong answer,
but it may take a bit longer to get to the correct answer.  This behavior
in PEigS should be fixed for the next major release.

<font color="purple">Tabs are not working for input decks under Linux.</font>
<p>
g77 effectively translates tabs into spaces.  This is also true for
character and Hollerith constants which we use to help us parse the
tabs in an input deck.  This results in problems with input decks that
have tabs in them.  Generally the error message shows up as:
<p>
<pre>
geom_input:center is neither atom nor bq       0
</pre>
<p>
We hope to have this fixed in the next major
release, but, in the meantime, get rid of the tabs in your input decks
and everything should work fine.

<pre>


</pre>
<font color="purple">Task shell is not working under Linux.</font>
<p>
This turns out to be a function of ARMCI catching a signal from the
system call that "task shell" uses.  This has been fixed for the next
major release.  If this functionality is needed before then, please
contact <a href="mailto:nwchem-support@emsl.pnl.gov">
nwchem-support@emsl.pnl.gov</a> and request the fix.
<pre>



</pre>
<hr>
<a name="12"></a>
<pre>


</pre>
<font color="purple">QMD restarts are not working properly.</font>
<p>
Velocities are not saved for restarts so restarts of Quantum Molecular
Dynamics (QMD) runs will not start with the correct velocities.  This
is fixed for the next major release.  If this functionality is needed before then, please
contact <a href="mailto:nwchem-support@emsl.pnl.gov">
nwchem-support@emsl.pnl.gov</a> and request the fix.

<font color="purple">CCSD(T) does not treat non-Abelian systems correctly.</font>
<p>
There is a bug in the CCSD(T) code which may cause the code to give the
error<br><p> moints_trp: symmetry contamination: 2(2) <br><p>
when performing calculations
on non-Abelian systems.  The user should run this calculation with symmetry
either turned off or in a proper Abelian subgroup.
<pre>



</pre>

<pre>


</pre>
<font color="purple">DFT BSSE Calculation</font> 
<p> 
There is a bug in the DFT code which gives wrong results when ghost atoms 
are present. This has been fixed for the next release. 
<pre> 



</pre> 
<hr>
<a name="15"></a>
<pre>


</pre>
<font color="purple">Compile problem on Sun processors with workshop 4.2</font>
<p>
The user will get a fatal error when compiling
nwchem/src/util/errquit.F that can be resolved by removing 
the -DJOBTIMEPATH definition in the makefile in the util directory. 
 A better solution is to upgrade to at least workshop 5.0.
