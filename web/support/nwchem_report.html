<center><h1>Java reporting tool for NWChem</h1></center>

 There is a new tool developed by Danielle Farrar
 for reporting NWChem 
 problems.  You can invoke this tool on mpp1 by typing: <p>

 /u/nwchem/bin/report<p> 

 This sets the environment so that java will work for you and then runs 
 the java application. <p> 

 Note that you will need to make sure that your DISPLAY variable is set
 correctly on mpp1 (i.e. setenv DISPLAY your.hostname:0.0) and that you
 are allowing X windows on your local machine (i.e. xhost + mpp1.emsl.pnl.gov).<p>

 If you put a file "nwchemsupport" in your home directory with your 
 proper email address (e.g., david.dixon@pnl.gov) this tool will 
 automatically pick this up as your preferred email address for this 
 tool.  You may link this file to your .forward if you like:<p> 

 ln -s .forward nwchemsupport<p> 

 The tool looks very much like the NWChem support queue web page but there is 
 something extra.  The tool allows you to attach your input file, 
 output file and an additional file (your error file on mpp1) to 
 the message.  The attachment mechanism uses the standard file browsing 
 mechanisms you are used to with java and other GUIs.  <p>

 Using this tool will help the NWChem staff better serve your needs.  <p>

 For users inside PNNL:<br>
 This tool is available as well from AFS on your workstations.  It has 
 only been tested for the SUNs but should work with any workstation 
 that has DFS mounted.  We use the 1.1.3 java tools in DFS land on the 
 suns.  <p>


 /msrc/proj/nwchem/bin/report  <p>

 will set your java environment and run the application for you.  <p>

For users outside PNNL:<br>
This tool is available for the offsite contact person for NWChem.  (Remember
that support is not provided for general users of NWChem who are not PNNL
collaborators.)  The report tool is available in the standard distribution
of NWChem.  Java
1.1 will be needed since the tool is based on that version of the java.awt
event handling.
