   <p>
   The optimizer of first choice should be the default option of
       user-specified Cartesian coordinates and DRIVER using redundant
       internal coordinates (AUTOZ - automatic Z-matrix).  The example
       input optimizes the structure of H3C-COOH using 3-21g SCF.

   AUTOZ will generate a set of redundant internal coordinates
       for the optimization.  Under some circumstances AUTOZ will fail
       to generate a good set of coordinates, in which case Cartesians
       will be used.  If you specify the geometry with a Z-matrix then
       your coordinates will be used for the optimization.
   <p>
       Needless to say a good guess for the geometry is very important.
       If you don't have a good guess, then first optimize with an
       inexpensive level of theory to get a good guess.

   <font color="purple">How do I accelerate a geometry optimization using information from
       a lower (cheaper) level of theory, and does this really help?
   </font>
   <p>
   It can help a lot and is especially worth doing for most large
       basis set calculations with correlated wavefunctions.
   <p>
       The geometry and Hessian information from a previous optimization
       are used by default --- if you saved them.  You should keep all
       of the files that NWChem puts into its permanent directory.
   <p>
   <ol>
   <li>Set the permanent directory to be somewhere permanent (sic).
          The default is the current directory, which for a batch job on the
          EMSL HP is /scratch.  If you plan on running both optimizations
          in the same input then you don't really need to do this, but if
          anything goes wrong you can only restart if you have saved the
          files.</li>
   <li>Run the first optimization with a low-level theory.
   <li>In the same job, or a subsequent one, specify the new
          wavefunction parameters and run the second optimization.  By
          default the calculation will restart from the previously
          converged geometry, but if you can estimate better values you
          can specify a new geometry (e.g., MP2 often predicts longer bond
          lengths than Hartree-Fock).
   </ol>
   <p>
       In the first example below, the geometry of H3C-COOH is first
       optimized using 3-21g SCF, and then, starting from the 3-21g SCF
       geometry and Hessian information, re-optimized with cc-pvdz MP2.
       The first optimization required 8 steps, taking 105s on a 360 MHz
       SUN Ultra-60.  The second optimization required 4 steps and 3882s.
       If the MP2 optimization is repeated starting again from the 3-21g
       SCF geometry, but not using the Hessian information then it takes 6
       steps and 4,900s.

       This next example performs SCF geometry optimizations of the water
       dimer in a sequence of increasing basis sets.  Each calculation
       starts from the geometry and updated-Hessian from the previous one.
       The steps taken for each successive optimization are, 11, 6, 7, 9,
       4, 4, 4 and the total calculation took 966s.  If the Hessian
       information is not reused (but still using the previous geometry)
       the steps taken are 11, 11, 13, 13, 6, 11, 10, taking 2100s.

   <font color="purple">When should I use STEPPER rather than DRIVER?
   </font>
   <p>
       In releases prior to 3.3, STEPPER was much more robust than DRIVER,
       especially for transition state searches, though when DRIVER did
       converge it was usually faster.  However, in release 3.3 DRIVER has
       been completely rewritten, AUTOZ has been extensively modified, and
       the diagonal guess for internal coordinates has also been
       substantially improved.  The net result is that if internal
       coordinates are available (AUTOZ or Z-matrix) then DRIVER is always
       preferable since STEPPER can only use Cartesians.  There is less
       data for the performance difference in Cartesians, but again DRIVER
       seems to have the edge, perhaps because it is less conservative and
       the use of a line search also enables it to take larger steps.
   <p>
       However, STEPPER was designed for stream-bed walking and has robust
       algorithms for following normal modes from a minimum up to
       transition states.  DRIVER can do this, but is not as robust.  So if
       you want to walk a long way along a mode, and are prepared to
       compute a full Hessian at the minimum geometry, then STEPPER is for
       you.

   <font color="purple">AUTOZ fails to generate valid internal coordinates.  Now what?
   </font>
   <p>
       If AUTOZ fails, NWChem will default to using Cartesian coordinates
       (and ignore any zcoord data) so you don't have to do anything
       unless you really need to use internal coordinates. An exception are
       certain cases where we have a molecule that contains a linear chain
       of 4 or more atoms, in which case the code will fail (see item 2.
       for work arounds). For small
       systems you can easily construct a Z-matrix, but for larger systems
       this can be quite hard.
   <p>
       First check your input.  Are you using the correct units?  The
       default is Angstroms.  If you input atomic units but did not tell
       NWChem, then it's no wonder things are breaking.  Also, is the
       geometry physically sensible?  If atoms are too close to each other
       you'll get many unphysical bonds, whereas if they are too far
       apart AUTOZ will not be able to figure out how to connect things.
   <p>
       Once the obvious has been checked, there are several possible modes
       of failure, some of which may be worked around in the input.
   <ol>
   <li>Strictly linear molecules with 3 or more atoms.  AUTOZ does not
          generate linear bend coordinates, but, just as in a real
          Z-matrix, you can specify a dummy center that is not co-linear.
          There are two relevant tips:
     <ul>
     <li>constrain the dummy center to be not co-linear otherwise the
            center could become co-linear. Also, the inevitable small
            forces on the dummy center can confuse the optimizer.</li>
     <li>put the dummy center far enough away so that only one
            connection is generated.

   <li>Larger molecules that contain a strictly linear chain of four or
          more atoms (that ends in a free atom). For these molecules the
          autoz will fail and the code can currently not recover by using
          cartesians. One has to explicitly define noautoz in the geometry
          input to make it work. If internal coordinates are required one
          can fix it in the same manner as described above. However, you can
          also force a connection to a real nearby atom.</li>
   <li>Very highly connected systems generate too many internal
          coordinates which can make optimization in redundant internals
          less efficient than in Cartesians.  For systems such as clusters
          of atoms or small molecules, try using a smaller value of the
          scaling factor for covalent radii
   <p>
          zcoord; cvr_scaling 0.9; end
   <p>

          bonds to connect the fragments.</li>
   </ol>
   <p>
          If these together don't work, then you're out of luck.  Use

       Driver's restart information may be discarded by putting the CLEAR

       directive is not remembered, so that subsequent geometry
       optimizations will use restart info unless also preceded by a
       DRIVER input block with a CLEAR directive.

       The restart filename expected by Driver is *.drv.hess, while the
       the filename when INHESS=2 is *.hess.

   <ol>
   <li>One cause could be insufficient precision in the gradient.
          Sometimes higher precision than the default is necessary,
          especially if you have asked for tight convergence.  Also, if
          you are using DFT, or MP2 in a large diffuse basis, then the
          gradient itself may be not be sufficiently accurate by default.
          The precision in the gradient can be improved by
     <ol>
     <li> SCF ... simply decrease THRESH.  The default is 1d-4.  A value
            of 1d-6 should suffice. If you are asking for tight
            convergence, or in pathological cases such as strong linear
            dependence, then use 1d-8.</li>
     <li> DFT ... improve the resolution of the grid (try FINE or one of
            the Lebedev grids) and the convergence threshold for the
            density.  You can check if the grid resolution is adequate by
            looking at the value of the numerically integrated density.
            The error in this number is roughly the same magnitude as that
            in the gradients.  If this error is too large and you are
            already using a FINE or XFINE grid, try increasing the
            screening radius (e.g., TOLERANCES ACCQRAD 20).</li>
     <li> MP2 ... use the TIGHT keyword.  This tightens up thresholds in
            the SCF, CPHF and MP2.</li>
     </ol></li>
   <li>If the geometry has changed a lot and you are using AUTOZ the
          redundant internals generated at the initial geometry may no
          longer be appropriate.  Try restarting the optimization from the
          last good geometry generating new redundant variables using the
          directive REDOAUTOZ.</li>
   <li>Did you input your own Z-matrix or specify additional
          coordinates for AUTOZ?  If the variables don't correspond to
          standard molecular internal coordinates then the initial guess
          for the Hessian is not necessarily very good, and the actual
          Hessian may not be well conditioned.  You can switch from your
          own Z-matrix to redundant internals with this trick

   <li>Flat potential energy surfaces such as internal coordinates

          starting geometry and some more Hessian information by
          optimizing at the lowest acceptable level of theory before using

       With either user-defined redundant internal coordinates, or a

   <font color="purple">How do I restart a geometry optimization?
   </font>
   <p>
       If you have saved the restart information that is kept in the
       permanent directory, then you can restart a calculation, as long as
       it did not crash while writing to the data base.
   <p>
       Following are two input files.  The first starts a geometry
       optimization for ammonia.  If this stops for nearly any reason such
       as it was interrupted, ran out of time or disk space, or exceeded
       the maximum number of iterations, then it may be restarted with the
       second job.
   <p>
       The key points are
   <ol>
   <li>The first job contains a START directive with a name for the
          calculation.</li>

   <li>All subsequent jobs should contain a RESTART directive with the
          same name for the calculation.</li>

   <li>All jobs must specify the same permanent directory.  The default
          permanent directory is the current directory.</li>

   <li>If you want to change anything in the restart job, just put the
          data before the task directive.  Otherwise, all options will be
          the same as in the original job.</li>

   <p>
       Yes.
   <p>
       With Cartesian coordinates either
   <ul>
   <li>list all atoms in any orientation and use the AUTOSYM keyword for
       automatic detection of the point group, or </li>

   <li>list all, or just the unique, atoms in the standard NWChem
       orientation for the point group and specify the point group with
       the SYMMETRY directive. </li>

       If you are using a Z-matrix you can only use the AUTOSYM keyword.

   <font color="purple">How do I find a transition state?
   </font>
   <p>
        A fairly reliable approach is to
   <p>
   <ol>
   <li>Optimize the reactants and products</li>

   <li>Identify the key internal variables involved in the reaction</li>

   <li>Generate an initial guess for the saddle geometry by either
           guessing or scanning the coordinates.  Do a constrained
           minimization at this point to relax the geometry.</li>

   <li>From the relaxed initial guess, search for the saddle point
           using the default options (releasing unnecessary constraints).
           The default option is to take the first step uphill.  If this
           does not manage to locate the negative mode, then try taking
           the first step along one of the bonds being made/broken
           (using the DRIVER directive VARDIR).</li>
   </ol>
   <p>
        Steps 1) & 3) are covered elsewhere in the FAQ.  Step
        2) is your problem.  Step 4) is done as follows
   <p>
        E.g., find the transition state for CH3+HF <-> CH4 + F
        given a starting guess for the transition state.
   <pre>

          geometry autosym
             c    0.000   0.000  -1.220
             h    0.000   0.000   0.029
             h    1.063   0.000  -1.407
             h   -0.531  -0.921  -1.407
             h   -0.531   0.921  -1.407
             f    0.000   0.000   1.279
          end

          basis
            c library 3-21g; h library 3-21g; f library 3-21g
          end

          scf; doublet; uhf; thresh 1e-6; print none; end

          task scf saddle

   </pre>
          Note that it is often necessary to specify manually internal
          coordinates for the bonds being broken/made since the algorithms
          inside AUTOZ are optimized for geometries near minima.
   <p>
   Another useful tip is to tighten up the precision in the gradient, which
   can decrease the number of steps needed to reach the transition state.
          The precision in the gradient can be improved by
   <ul>
   <li>SCF ... simply decrease THRESH.  The default is 1d-4.  A value
            of 1d-6 should suffice. If you are asking for tight
            convergence, or in pathological cases such as strong linear
            dependence, then use 1d-8.</li>

   <li>DFT ... improve the resolution of the grid (try FINE or one of
            the Lebedev grids) and the convergence threshold for the
            density.  You can check if the grid resolution is adequate by
            looking at the value of the numerically integrated density.
            The error in this number is roughly the same magnitude as that
            in the gradients.  If this error is too large and you are
            already using a FINE or XFINE grid, try increasing the
            screening radius (e.g., TOLERANCES ACCQRAD 20).</li>

   <li>MP2 ... use the TIGHT keyword.  This tightens up thresholds in
            the SCF, CPHF and MP2.</li>
   </ul>
