 <p>
 Remember that you can <b>(and should!)</b> look at your initial orbitals
 by putting the line<br>
 <pre>
 print "initial vectors"
 </pre>
 <p>
 into the SCF block of your input deck.  If the order isn't correct, you can use
 the "swap" directive to change the order of the orbitals.
 <p>
 For example:
 <pre>
 vectors atomic swap 173 175 174 176 output end.movecs
 </pre>
 will cause the orbitals 173 - 175 to be swapped to 175, 176, 173 and 174.
 Note that the swaps are pairwise: first 173 and 175 are swapped, then the
 the current orbitals 174 and 176 are swapped.  More information on initial orbitals
 can be obtained in <a href="http://www.emsl.pnl.gov/docs/nwchem/doc/user/node12.html#SECTION001250000000000000000" target="_blank">

 <font color="purple"> I am having problems getting an open shell system to converge.  What strategies will help me?</font>
 <p>
 Open shell systems, especially those containing transition metals or heavy
 elements with many unoccupied d and f orbitals, can be especially hard
 to converge.  Running a spin unrestricted calculation can exacerbate the
 problem since all other possible spin states can mix into the wavefunction.
 It may also be true that your particular calculation has multireference
 character and, by using SCF or DFT, you are forcing it into a single
 determinate wavefunction.
 <p>
 That being said, to converge your system, you need to guide the code
 to the particular state that you want.  This may be a very difficult
 task and different starting guesses can converge to different solutions,
 especially if there is symmetry breaking.  Here are four different
 suggestions to help you with your problem:
 <ol>
 <li> Use Auf bau construction.  Start by removing most or all of the
 open-shell electrons and converge the resulting closed-shell wavefunction.
 Incrementally add the missing electrons, maintaining a closed-shell form for
 the wavefunction until the last calculation.  Once you have an ROHF
 wavefunction converged, then do the UHF calculation if desired (note that
 UHF is the only option with the DFT code).  When adding electrons, pay
 attention to how well separated the virtual orbitals are in energy.</li>
 <li> Converge a very high multiplicity state and then incrementally
 pair electrons until you get the state you want.</li>
 <li> Converge in a minimal basis set where there is very little variational
 freedom and it is not as expensive to run many iterations.  Then
 <a href="http://www.emsl.pnl.gov/docs/nwchem/doc/user/node12.html#SECTION001250000000000000000">project</a>
 to a larger basis set (you can use this
 <a href="http://www.emsl.pnl.gov/docs/nwchem/support/proj.nw">example</a>
 as a model).
 It is also useful to use spherical functions since this
 tends to decrease the amount of linear dependence.  This method isn't
 as reliable as the previous methods.</li>
 <li> Use the <a href="http://www.emsl.pnl.gov/docs/nwchem/doc/user/node12.html#SECTION001251000000000000000">fragment</a>
 guess.  This is especially useful if you know the configuration of the atoms.
 Prepare the atoms in the appropriate state and assemble the molecule from the fragments.
 If you want an antiferromagnetic state, this is the only way to do it.</li>
 </ol>

 <p>
 This problem usually shows up when a minimum basis set is used and where a
 lot of charge has to be moved a long way but the minimal basis does not
 providea lot of coupling between the orbitals.  The initial guess may be
 modified by
 <ol>
 <li><a href="http://www.emsl.pnl.gov/docs/nwchem/doc/user/node12.html#SECTION001252000000000000000">putting the charge on the atoms</a>
 where it is believed to be,</li>
 <li> look at the orbitals and
 <a href="http://www.emsl.pnl.gov/docs/nwchem/doc/user/node12.html#SECTION001250000000000000000">swap the orbitals</a>
 to obtain the correct occupation, or</li>
 <li> ue the <a href="http://www.emsl.pnl.gov/docs/nwchem/doc/user/node12.h
 tml#SECTION001251000000000000000">fragment</a> guess.</li>
 </ol>
 Better yet, use a better basis set which will allow for better coupling of
 the orbitals!

 <font color="purple"> I am having convergence problems with the final iterations of a calculation using a large basis set.  What can I do?</font>
 <p>
 This problem generally occurs when high precision is necessary because of
 near linear dependencies in the basis set and there is insufficient precision
 in the computed gradient or hessian vector product to converge to the
 requested threshold.  The first item to check is to make sure that the convergence
 <a href="http://www.emsl.pnl.gov/docs/nwchem/doc/user/node12.html#SECTION001270000000000000000">threshold</a> is realistic (not below 1e<sup>-7</sup> or
 perhaps 1e<sup>-8</sup>).  If doing an MP2 gradient with the
 <a href="http://www.emsl.pnl.gov/docs/nwchem/doc/user/node17.html#SECTION001712000000000000000">TIGHT</a> directive, make sure the SCF input block is
 after the MP2 block and then in the SCF block put
 <pre>
 SCF
   thresh 1e-7
   tol2e 1e-10
 END
 </pre>
 This may still not fix the problem if the calculation is using the semi-direct
 algorithm.  In this case:
 <ol>
 <li>Run the calculation on enough nodes to run fully disk resident,</li>
 <li>Run as before, but switch off the density screening with<p>
     set fock:densityscreen f<p></li>
 <li>Run the calculation fully direct.</li>
 </ol>

 <font color="purple"> Do you have an example of a complex fragment guess?</font>
 <p>
 The following is an advanced fragment guess (NOT for beginners!).  It consists
 of two Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions in a simulated lattice and the objective is
 to compute the energy difference between the ferro and anti-ferromagnetic
 states.  This is accomplished by first using the atomic guess to do an ROHF
 calculation on an Fe<sup>3+</sup> ion with d<sup>5</sup> occupation.  The
 next calculation is on the high spin system and it merely has to start from
 the two ions ... the open shell orbitals will automatically be contiguous and
 so nothing else is needed.
 <p>
 The final calculation is a UHF for which the 5 open shell electrons on one
 atom must be spin up and on the other spin down.  The initial guess orbitals
 start off from the previous high spin solution.
 However, the d orbitals
 on the second atom must have the beta orbitals in the right place, hence
 the swap directive.  The net result is a completely localized guess with the
 desired spin coupling.

 For DFT calculation you can either the same method just shown or a
 different approach that is illustrated in this
