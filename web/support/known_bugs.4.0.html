<font color="purple">Compile problem on Sun processors with workshop 4.2</font>
<p>
The user will get a fatal error when compiling
nwchem/src/util/errquit.F that can be resolved by removing 
the -DJOBTIMEPATH definition in the GNUmakefile in the util directory.  
A better solution is to upgrade to at least workshop 5.0.

<font color="purple"> Possible compile problems with True64 Compaq Fortran</font>
<p>
Some versions of True64 Compaq Fortran default f77 to point to f90 and
the compile will break because of problems with cpp and f90.  This has
been reported for V5.3-915.  There are three known solutions:
<ol>
<li>Change the f77 link to point to f77 instead of f90,</li>
<li>Add the flag -old_f77 as the first flag in the FC definition of the
DECOSF section of the $NWCHEM_TOP/src/config/makefile.h file, or</li>
<li>Upgrade to version X5.3-1155 plus the patches at

Cross-compiling problems on the IBM SP</font>
<p>
The PeIGS code is automatically picking up the architecture it is being
compiled on for LAPI (SP) builds, thus causing problems with cross-compiling.

Level shift is included in DFT unoccupied orbital energies</font>
<p>
DFT unoccupied orbital energies
include the level shift value used to converge the wavefunction (if active).
If you 
use these energies for any reason, you need to subtract out the level-shifting 
value. Check out the

QM MD restarts fail under MPI</font>
<p>
An error will occur when trying to restart quantum mechanics (QM) molecular
dynamics (MD) runs when the executable is compiled for MPI.  The error looks
like an an unexisting file error.

Failure reading in cartesian hessian from a previous frequency calculation</font>
<p>
When run in parallel, reading in of a cartesian hessian from a previous 
frequency calculation causes a segmentation fault.
<font color="red">This is now fixed in version 4.0.1.</font>

<hr>
<a name="7">
<p>
<font color="purple">
MD restart files are overwritten</font>
<p>
Every time the prepare module was run, the restart file was written at the end.
This also was done if this is not strictly needed.  As a result the history
of the restart file was lost.  This does not cause anything to break, but
during a set of simulations, the history is lost if, for example, the restart
file was converted into a PDB formatted file.  
<font color="red">This is now fixed in version 4.0.1.</font>

<a name="8">
<p>
<font color="purple">
Order of variables for the LINK card in the PDB file is incorrect</font>
<p>
The order of variables written for the LINK card in the PDB file is
incorrect.  Normally this card is written to the PDB file only when
distances between a pair of link atoms of different segments is larger
than the prepare module would be able to recognize as a bond.  In that
case, a LINK card is written so that subsequent use of the prepare module
would force a bond between these atoms.  With the incorrect LINK card the 
prepare module breaks.

Sometimes COSMO gradients are only for the gas phase part of the calculation</font>
<p>
If the COSMO module is used and "numeric" is not added to the task line, 
the results are for the gas phase system.  This effects gradient,
optimization and hessian runs.

The COSMO code is getting a SEGV</font>
<p>
In all likelihood, you are using spherical basis sets in the calculation.
This will fail since the code only works in cartesians.

DFT Open-shell calculation with the Exchange functionals
<tt>xpbe96</tt> and <tt>xperdew91</tt> produce wrong gradients</font>
<p>
There is a problem with the code only when running open-shell calculations
with these two functionals.
A way to avoid this problem is to introduce the
following line in the input file:
<p><tt>set "dft:weight derivatives" f</tt>
<p>However, gradients are going to be less accurate since the XC grid derivatives
will not be included.  The user is encouraged to use the <tt>GRID</tt> keyword
in the <tt>DFT</tt> block to increase the accuracy of the grid.

Medium and large size calculation under Linux produce NaNs</font>

<br><a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/linux/linux-kernel/2001-16/0641.html">
Re: BUG: Global FPU corruption in 2.2</a>
<p>We have experienced the same problems running NWChem with a 2.2.x kernel. 
This is likely due to FPU problems that has been fixed in kernel
2.2.20 and in the 2.4 series.
<br>To fix the problem, we strongly suggest you to install 2.4.x
kernels available at
<p>
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/">http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/</a> 
<br>
<p>
or to upgrade your 2.2 kernel to version 2.2.20, whose source is
available at
<p>

GM versions before 1.3 cause compilation errors</font>

If you are using a version of GM more recent than 1.3, you are going to experience a

DFT calculations on molecules containg ghost atoms fail</font>
<p>
Because of bugs in the new XC grid schem available in NWChem 4.0, DFT 
calculations on molecules containg ghost atoms fail.
<br>To revert back to the old XC grid scheme and avoid the problem, insert the 
following line in the <tt>dft</tt> field

If you have the NWChem source code, you can apply the following 
<a

I am getting an "There are insufficient internal variables"
error</font>
<p>
If you have a chemical system that has "sensitive" internal
coordinates, the B and B inverse code can have problems.  By
sensitive, we mean that a small change in one internal coordinate
has a large effect on the cartesian or internal coordinates of other
atoms.
<p>
<font color="red"> A modification will be available for the next
release which makes the code a bit less sensitive to this problem.
<p>
NOTE: Even with the modification, there still may be problems when
using internal coordinates in a system that has sensitive internals
when performing an optimization.  The optimization may proceed slowly
or there may be problems in calculating B inverse.</font>
