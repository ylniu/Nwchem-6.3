<a name="notask"></a>
<font color="purple">I get the message:<tt> ! warning: processed input with no task</tt>. What is wrong? </font>
<p>
Have you used emacs to create your input file?
Emacs usually does not put and an end-of-line
as a  last character of the file,
therefore the NWChem input parser ignores
the last line of your input
(the one containing the <tt>task</tt> directive).
<p>
To fix the problem,  add one more blank line
after the task line and your task directive will be executed.

<h3>Initial Guess and Convergence Problems</h3>
</p>


<hr>
<p>
<a name="8"></a>
<font color="purple"> I am having problems getting my initial guess
         in the correct order.  How I do use the swap directive? </font>
<p>
Remember that you can <b>(and should!)</b> look at your initial orbitals
by putting the line<br>
<p>
print "initial vectors"
<p>
into the SCF block of your input deck.  If the order isn't correct, you can use
the "swap" directive to change the order of the orbitals.
<p>
For example:
<pre>
vectors atomic swap 173 175 174 176 output end.movecs
</pre>
will cause the orbitals 173 - 175 to be swapped to 175, 176, 173 and 174.
Note that the swaps are pairwise: first 173 and 175 are swapped, then the
the current orbitals 174 and 176 are swapped.  More information on initial orbitals
can be obtained in <a href="http://www.emsl.pnl.gov/docs/nwchem/doc/user/node12.html#SECTION001250000000000000000" target="_blank">

<a name="openguess"></a>
<font color="purple"> I am having problems getting an open shell system to converge.  What strategies will help me?</font>
<p>
Open shell systems, especially those containing transition metals or heavy
elements with many unoccupied d and f orbitals, can be especially hard
to converge.  Running a spin unrestricted calculation can exacerbate the
problem since all other possible spin states can mix into the wavefunction.
It may also be true that your particular calculation has multireference
character and, by using SCF or DFT, you are forcing it into a single
determinate wavefunction.
<p>
That being said, to converge your system, you need to guide the code
to the particular state that you want.  This may be a very difficult
task and different starting guesses can converge to different solutions,
especially if there is symmetry breaking.  Here are four different
suggestions to help you with your problem:
<ol>
<li> Use Auf bau construction.  Start by removing most or all of the
open-shell electrons and converge the resulting closed-shell wavefunction.
Incrementally add the missing electrons, maintaining a closed-shell form for
the wavefunction until the last calculation.  Once you have an ROHF
wavefunction converged, then do the UHF calculation if desired (note that
UHF is the only option with the DFT code).  When adding electrons, pay
attention to how well separated the virtual orbitals are in energy.</li>
<li> Converge a very high multiplicity state and then incrementally
pair electrons until you get the state you want.</li>
<li> Converge in a minimal basis set where there is very little variational
freedom and it is not as expensive to run many iterations.  Then
<a href="http://www.emsl.pnl.gov/docs/nwchem/doc/user/node12.html#SECTION001250000000000000000">project</a>
to a larger basis set (you can use this
<a href="http://www.emsl.pnl.gov/docs/nwchem/support/proj.nw">example</a>
as a model).
It is also useful to use spherical functions since this
tends to decrease the amount of linear dependence.  This method isn't
as reliable as the previous methods.</li>
<li> Use the <a href="http://www.emsl.pnl.gov/docs/nwchem/doc/user/node12.html#SECTION001251000000000000000">fragment</a>
guess.  This is especially useful if you know the configuration of the atoms.
Prepare the atoms in the appropriate state and assemble the molecule from the fragments.
If you want an antiferromagnetic state, this is the only way to do it.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<a name="minchargeguess"></a>
<font color="purple"> I am having problems converging an ionic, extended system.  What can I do?</font>
<p>
This problem usually shows up when a minimum basis set is used and where a
lot of charge has to be moved a long way but the minimal basis does not
providea lot of coupling between the orbitals.  The initial guess may be
modified by
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.emsl.pnl.gov/docs/nwchem/doc/user/node12.html#SECTION001252000000000000000">putting the charge on the atoms</a>
where it is believed to be,</li>
<li> look at the orbitals and
<a href="http://www.emsl.pnl.gov/docs/nwchem/doc/user/node12.html#SECTION001250000000000000000">swap the orbitals</a>
to obtain the correct occupation, or</li>
<li> ue the <a href="http://www.emsl.pnl.gov/docs/nwchem/doc/user/node12.h
tml#SECTION001251000000000000000">fragment</a> guess.</li>
</ol>
Better yet, use a better basis set which will allow for better coupling of
the orbitals!
</p>

<hr>
<p>
<a name="accbbsconv"></a>

<font color="purple"> I am having convergence problems with the final iterations of a calculation using a large basis set.  What can I do?</font>
<p>
This problem generally occurs when high precision is necessary because of
near linear dependencies in the basis set and there is insufficient precision
in the computed gradient or hessian vector product to converge to the
requested threshold.  The first item to check is to make sure that the convergence
<a href="http://www.emsl.pnl.gov/docs/nwchem/doc/user/node12.html#SECTION001270000000000000000">threshold</a> is realistic (not below 1e<sup>-7</sup> or
perhaps 1e<sup>-8</sup>).  If doing an MP2 gradient with the
<a href="http://www.emsl.pnl.gov/docs/nwchem/doc/user/node17.html#SECTION001712000000000000000">TIGHT</a> directive, make sure the SCF input block is
after the MP2 block and then in the SCF block put
<pre>
SCF
  thresh 1e-7
  tol2e 1e-10
END
</pre>
This may still not fix the problem if the calculation is using the semi-direct
algorithm.  In this case:
<ol>
<li>Run the calculation on enough nodes to run fully disk resident,</li>
<li>Run as before, but switch off the density screening with<p>
    set fock:densityscreen f<p></li>
<li>Run the calculation fully direct.</li>
</ol>

<hr>
<p>
<a name="compfragguess"></a>

<font color="purple"> Do you have an example of a complex fragment guess?</font>
<p>
The following is an advanced fragment guess (NOT for beginners!).  It consists
of two Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions in a simulated lattice and the objective is
to compute the energy difference between the ferro and anti-ferromagnetic
states.  This is accomplished by first using the atomic guess to do an ROHF
calculation on an Fe<sup>3+</sup> ion with d<sup>5</sup> occupation.  The
next calculation is on the high spin system and it merely has to start from
the two ions ... the open shell orbitals will automatically be contiguous and
so nothing else is needed.
<p>
The final calculation is a UHF for which the 5 open shell electrons on one
atom must be spin up and on the other spin down.  The initial guess orbitals
start off from the previous high spin solution.
However, the d orbitals
on the second atom must have the beta orbitals in the right place, hence
the swap directive.  The net result is a completely localized guess with the
desired spin coupling.

<h3>Basis Sets</h3>

<p>
<a name="basistags"></a>
<font color="purple"> How do the basis sets get assigned to the atoms in my input deck?</font>
<p>
The tags associated with atoms (e.g. H, H1, Hydrogen) are mapped to the tags
used in the basis set definitions by:
<ol>
<li> If there is an exact match, then use it<p>
  E.g., if H1 appears in both the geometry and the basis, then the H1
  basis set is used.</li><p>
<li> If there is not an exact match, then if there is a basis set defined for
  that element, then use it<p>
  E.g., if H1 appears in the geometry but not in the basis, then try to
  use a basis set for H or for Hydrogen.  It will not try to match another
  tag such as H2 in the basis set.</li><p>
<li> If two definitions are given for an element in the basis set, then use
  the definition such that the basis set tag is completely matched (or
  is a substring) of the geometry tag.<p>
  E.g., if H1, Hydrogen1, and Hydro1 appear in the geometry and H and
  Hydrogen appear in the basis, H1 will map to H, Hydrogen1 will map to
  Hydrogen, and Hydro1 will map to H.  You are STRONGLY advised not to
  do perverse inputs such as Hydro1 which can only cause confusion.</li>

<h3>Optimization Issues (including transition states)</h3>

<p>
The optimizer of first choice should be the default option of
    user-specified Cartesian coordinates and DRIVER using redundant
    internal coordinates (AUTOZ - automatic Z-matrix).  The example
    input optimizes the structure of H3C-COOH using 3-21g SCF.

</pre>
AUTOZ will generate a set of redundant internal coordinates
    for the optimization.  Under some circumstances AUTOZ will fail
    to generate a good set of coordinates, in which case Cartesians
    will be used.  If you specify the geometry with a Z-matrix then
    your coordinates will be used for the optimization.
<p>
    Needless to say a good guess for the geometry is very important.
    If you don't have a good guess, then first optimize with an
    inexpensive level of theory to get a good guess.

<font color="purple">How do I accelerate a geometry optimization using information from

</font>
<p>
It can help a lot and is especially worth doing for most large
    basis set calculations with correlated wavefunctions.
<p>
    The geometry and Hessian information from a previous optimization
    are used by default --- if you saved them.  You should keep all
    of the files that NWChem puts into its permanent directory.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Set the permanent directory to be somewhere permanent (sic).
       The default is the current directory, which for a batch job on the
       EMSL HP is /scratch.  If you plan on running both optimizations
       in the same input then you don't really need to do this, but if
       anything goes wrong you can only restart if you have saved the
       files.</li>
<li>Run the first optimization with a low-level theory.
<li>In the same job, or a subsequent one, specify the new
       wavefunction parameters and run the second optimization.  By
       default the calculation will restart from the previously
       converged geometry, but if you can estimate better values you
       can specify a new geometry (e.g., MP2 often predicts longer bond
       lengths than Hartree-Fock).
</ol>
<p>
    In the first example below, the geometry of H3C-COOH is first
    optimized using 3-21g SCF, and then, starting from the 3-21g SCF
    geometry and Hessian information, re-optimized with cc-pvdz MP2.
    The first optimization required 8 steps, taking 105s on a 360 MHz
    SUN Ultra-60.  The second optimization required 4 steps and 3882s.
    If the MP2 optimization is repeated starting again from the 3-21g
    SCF geometry, but not using the Hessian information then it takes 6
    steps and 4,900s.

<a name="stepper"></a>
<font color="purple">When should I use STEPPER rather than DRIVER?
</font>
<p>
    In releases prior to 3.3, STEPPER was much more robust than DRIVER,
    especially for transition state searches, though when DRIVER did
    converge it was usually faster.  However, in release 3.3 DRIVER has
    been completely rewritten, AUTOZ has been extensively modified, and
    the diagonal guess for internal coordinates has also been
    substantially improved.  The net result is that if internal
    coordinates are available (AUTOZ or Z-matrix) then DRIVER is always
    preferable since STEPPER can only use Cartesians.  There is less
    data for the performance difference in Cartesians, but again DRIVER
    seems to have the edge, perhaps because it is less conservative and
    the use of a line search also enables it to take larger steps.
<p>
    However, STEPPER was designed for stream-bed walking and has robust
    algorithms for following normal modes from a minimum up to
    transition states.  DRIVER can do this, but is not as robust.  So if
    you want to walk a long way along a mode, and are prepared to
    compute a full Hessian at the minimum geometry, then STEPPER is for
    you.

<a name="autozfail"></a>
<font color="purple">AUTOZ fails to generate valid internal coordinates.  Now what?
</font>
<p>
    If AUTOZ fails, NWChem will default to using Cartesian coordinates
    (and ignore any zcoord data) so you don't have to do anything
    unless you really need to use internal coordinates. An exception are
    certain cases where we have a molecule that contains a linear chain
    of 4 or more atoms, in which case the code will fail (see item 2.
    for work arounds). For small
    systems you can easily construct a Z-matrix, but for larger systems
    this can be quite hard.
<p>
    First check your input.  Are you using the correct units?  The
    default is Angstroms.  If you input atomic units but did not tell
    NWChem, then it's no wonder things are breaking.  Also, is the
    geometry physically sensible?  If atoms are too close to each other
    you'll get many unphysical bonds, whereas if they are too far
    apart AUTOZ will not be able to figure out how to connect things.
<p>
    Once the obvious has been checked, there are several possible modes
    of failure, some of which may be worked around in the input.
<ol>
<li>Strictly linear molecules with 3 or more atoms.  AUTOZ does not
       generate linear bend coordinates, but, just as in a real
       Z-matrix, you can specify a dummy center that is not co-linear.
       There are two relevant tips:
  <ul>
  <li>constrain the dummy center to be not co-linear otherwise the
         center could become co-linear. Also, the inevitable small
         forces on the dummy center can confuse the optimizer.</li>
  <li>put the dummy center far enough away so that only one
         connection is generated.
  </ul>

<li>Larger molecules that contain a strictly linear chain of four or
       more atoms (that ends in a free atom). For these molecules the
       autoz will fail and the code can currently not recover by using
       cartesians. One has to explicitly define noautoz in the geometry
       input to make it work. If internal coordinates are required one
       can fix it in the same manner as described above. However, you can
       also force a connection to a real nearby atom.</li>
<li>Very highly connected systems generate too many internal
       coordinates which can make optimization in redundant internals
       less efficient than in Cartesians.  For systems such as clusters
       of atoms or small molecules, try using a smaller value of the
       scaling factor for covalent radii
<p>

       In addition to this you can also try specifying a minimal set of

<p>
<ol>
<li>One cause could be insufficient precision in the gradient.
       Sometimes higher precision than the default is necessary,
       especially if you have asked for tight convergence.  Also, if
       you are using DFT, or MP2 in a large diffuse basis, then the
       gradient itself may be not be sufficiently accurate by default.
       The precision in the gradient can be improved by
  <ol>
  <li> SCF ... simply decrease THRESH.  The default is 1d-4.  A value
         of 1d-6 should suffice. If you are asking for tight
         convergence, or in pathological cases such as strong linear
         dependence, then use 1d-8.</li>
  <li> DFT ... improve the resolution of the grid (try FINE or one of
         the Lebedev grids) and the convergence threshold for the
         density.  You can check if the grid resolution is adequate by
         looking at the value of the numerically integrated density.
         The error in this number is roughly the same magnitude as that
         in the gradients.  If this error is too large and you are
         already using a FINE or XFINE grid, try increasing the
         screening radius (e.g., TOLERANCES ACCQRAD 20).</li>

<li>If the geometry has changed a lot and you are using AUTOZ the

<li>Did you input your own Z-matrix or specify additional

       standard molecular internal coordinates then the initial guess
       for the Hessian is not necessarily very good, and the actual

<a name="findts"></a>
<font color="purple">How do I find a transition state?
</font>
<p>
     A fairly reliable approach is to
<p>
<ol>
<li>Optimize the reactants and products</li>

<li>Identify the key internal variables involved in the reaction</li>

<li>Generate an initial guess for the saddle geometry by either
        guessing or scanning the coordinates.  Do a constrained
        minimization at this point to relax the geometry.</li>

<li>From the relaxed initial guess, search for the saddle point
        using the default options (releasing unnecessary constraints).
        The default option is to take the first step uphill.  If this
        does not manage to locate the negative mode, then try taking
        the first step along one of the bonds being made/broken
        (using the DRIVER directive VARDIR).</li>
</ol>
<p>
     Steps 1) & 3) are covered elsewhere in the FAQ.  Step
     2) is your problem.  Step 4) is done as follows
<p>
     E.g., find the transition state for CH3+HF <-> CH4 + F
     given a starting guess for the transition state.
<pre>

       geometry autosym
          c    0.000   0.000  -1.220
          h    0.000   0.000   0.029
          h    1.063   0.000  -1.407
          h   -0.531  -0.921  -1.407
          h   -0.531   0.921  -1.407
          f    0.000   0.000   1.279
       end

       basis
         c library 3-21g; h library 3-21g; f library 3-21g
       end

       scf; doublet; uhf; thresh 1e-6; print none; end

       task scf saddle

</pre>
       Note that it is often necessary to specify manually internal
       coordinates for the bonds being broken/made since the algorithms
       inside AUTOZ are optimized for geometries near minima.
<p>
Another useful tip is to tighten up the precision in the gradient, which
can decrease the number of steps needed to reach the transition state.
       The precision in the gradient can be improved by
<ul>
<li>SCF ... simply decrease THRESH.  The default is 1d-4.  A value
         of 1d-6 should suffice. If you are asking for tight
         convergence, or in pathological cases such as strong linear
         dependence, then use 1d-8.</li>

<li>DFT ... improve the resolution of the grid (try FINE or one of
         the Lebedev grids) and the convergence threshold for the
         density.  You can check if the grid resolution is adequate by
         looking at the value of the numerically integrated density.
         The error in this number is roughly the same magnitude as that
         in the gradients.  If this error is too large and you are
         already using a FINE or XFINE grid, try increasing the
         screening radius (e.g., TOLERANCES ACCQRAD 20).</li>

<li>MP2 ... use the TIGHT keyword.  This tightens up thresholds in
         the SCF, CPHF and MP2.</li>
</ul>

<font color="purple">How do I calculate MP2 properties?
</font>
<p>
The default molecular orbital file
$file_prefix$.movecs is used unless a VECTORS
subdirective is provided in the PROPERTY directive. It is therefore
necessary to include a VECTORS directive if the MO
vectors to be analyzed are not coming from the default
file, e.g., if they have been previously redirected, or if
MP2 natural orbitals (file extension ".mp2nos") are
being anaylzed.  So, to calculate MP2 properties, a PROPERTY
block directive similar to the one in the following example would
be appropriate:
<pre>

<font color="purple">My high symmetry MP2 calculation is taking longer that it

</font>
<p>
Currently MP2 can only use Abelian point groups and does not have descent of
symmetry implemented (meaning that it does not know how to use a proper
Abelian point group instead of an input non-Abelian group).  The user must
define the proper Abelian point group, orient the molecule into this point
group, and then run the MP2.

<p>
Yes, in all versions of NWChem including 4.0 and below, the DFT unoccupied
orbital energies are shifted by the amount of level-shifting used to
converge the wavefunction.  If you use these energies for any reason, you
need to subtract out the level-shifting value.  Check out the

<ol>
<li> Enter smit </li>
<li> Go to "Devices" </li>
<li> Go to "Asynchronous I/O" </li>
<li> Go to "Change / Show Characteristics of Asynchronous I/O" </li>
<li> Change "State of fast path" to "enable" </li>
<li> Make sure "STATE to be configured at system restart" is set to "available" </li>
<li> Exit smit</li>
</ol>
The nodes will need to be rebooted for the change to take effect.
<p>
The second solution is to compile GA without Asynchronous I/O turned on.
This WILL slow down the performance of NWChem.
<ol>
<li>cd $NWCHEM_TOP/src/tools/pario</li>
<li>make TARGET=LAPI clean</li>
<li>make TARGET=LAPI CC="cc -DNOAIO" LARGE_FILES=y</li>
<li>cd $NWCHEM_TOP/src</li>
<li>make link</li>
</ol>

 effects performance.
</font>
<p>
The default thread scheduling policy changed from AIX version 4.3 to 4.3.3
which effects MPI and LAPI programs that rely on switch packet arrival
interrupts (such as NWChem).  This directly effects the performance of
NWChem.  To change the default, you need to set the environment variable
RT_GRQ.  You can either do this in your environment:
<pre>
setenv RT_GRQ ON
</pre>
or you can set it in your LoadLeveller script:
<pre>
# @ environment      =    RT_GRQ=ON
</pre>
Note that you may have other variables to set with the environment line.  Just
add the variable onto the existing line using a semi-colon as a separator.  For
example:
<pre>
# @ environment      =    COPY_ALL; MP_INFOLEVEL=3; MP_PULSE=0;
MP_SINGLE_THREAD=yes; MP_WAIT_MODE=yield; RT_GRQ=ON; restart=no
</pre>

<font color="purple">How do I use more than 2 GB of disk space?</font>
<p>
During the compilation, the environment variable LARGE_FILES needs to be
set (i.e. setenv LARGE_FILES TRUE).  Also, you should make sure that the
file sizes on your system are not limited to 2 GB (type "limit" and check
the output).  If the sizes are limited, ask your system adminitrator to
change the limit for you.

<p>
The right target is <tt>WIN32.</tt> Before starting the compilation,
you must have installed the
Compaq Visual Fortran compiler (version 6.0 and 6.1 have been successfully
tested) and the NT.MPICH library
(<a href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/~ashton/mpich.nt/">http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/~ashton/mpich.nt/</a> ).
Then, you need to have defined this series of variables  (that you can
set in <tt> autoexec.bat</tt>)
<pre>
set NWCHEM_TOP=c:\nwchem
set NWCHEM_TARGET=WIN32
set MPI_INCLUDE=c:\PROGRA~1\ARGONN~1\MPICHN~1.4\SDK\INCLUDE
set MPI_LIB=c:\PROGRA~1\ARGONN~1\MPICHN~1.4\SDK\lib
set NWCHEM_EXTRA_LIBS=%MPI_LIB%\mpich.lib
</pre>
To start the compilation, start the Microsoft makefile utility from
the top level source directory by typing
<pre>
nmake
</pre>
The name of the executable is <tt> nw32.exe </tt>
